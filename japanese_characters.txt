As you would expect, it is written from left to right. 	  * As a primitive element, the key-word meaning is discarded, and the single horizontal stroke takes on the meaning of floor or ceiling, depending on its position: if it stands above another primitive, it means ceiling; if below, floor.

two	"two 	 	二   	   	Lesson: 1   Frame: 2   Strokes: 2   —   Jouyou Grade: 1   JLPT: 5   	Constituents: two 	 	Like the Roman numeral II, which reduplicates the numeral I, the kanji for two is a simple reduplication of the horizontal stroke that means one. The order of writing goes from above to below, with the first stroke slightly shorter. 	 	 	Two lines. 	 	On-Yomi: ニ、ジ   Kun-Yomi: ふた、ふた.つ、ふたた.び  	Examples: 二 (ふた), 二つ (ふた.つ)"
three	"three 	 	三   	   	Lesson: 1   Frame: 3   Strokes: 3   —   Jouyou Grade: 1   JLPT: 5   	Constituents: three 	 	And like the Roman numeral III, which triples the numeral I, the kanji for three simply triples the single horizontal stroke. In writing it, think of ""1 + 2 = 3"" (一 + 二 = 三) in order to keep the middle stroke shorter. 	 	 	One + two = three. 	 	On-Yomi: サン、ゾウ   Kun-Yomi: み、み.つ、みっ.つ  	Examples: 三 (み), 三つ (み.つ), 三つ (みっ.つ)"

Assuming that you already knew how to write this kanji, we will pass over the ""story"" connected with it until later. Note how the second stroke is written left-to-right and then top-to-bottom. This is consistent with what we have already seen in the first three numbers and leads us to a general principle that will be helpful when we come to more complicated kanji later on: write north-to-south, west-to-east, northwest-to-southeast. 	 	 	FOUR year-olds often put their FOOT (human legs) in their MOUTH - but they are too young to realize. 	 	On-Yomi: シ   Kun-Yomi: よ、よ.つ、よっ.つ、よん  	Examples: 四 (よ), 四つ (よ.つ), 四つ (よっ.つ), 四 (よん)"

Note how the general principle we just learned in the preceding frame applies to the writing of the character for five. 	 	 	三 + two vertical lines = 5.

This distinguishes seven from the character for spoon (Frame 476), in which the horizontal stroke stops short. 	  * As a primitive, this form takes on the meaning of diced, i.e., ""cut"" into little pieces, consistent both with the way the character is written and with its association with the kanji for cut to be learned in a later lesson (Frame 89). 	 	This kanji is our good old seven, turned upside down. 	 	On-Yomi: シチ   Kun-Yomi: なな、なな.つ、なの  	Examples: 七 (なな), 七つ (なな.つ)"
eight	"eight 	 	八   	   	Lesson: 1   Frame: 8   Strokes: 2   —   Jouyou Grade: 1   JLPT: 5   	Constituents: eight 	 	Just as the Arabic numeral ""8"" is composed of a small circle followed by a larger one, so the kanji for eight is composed of a short line followed by a longer line, slanting towards it but not touching it. And just as the ""lazy 8"" is the mathematical symbol for ""infinity,"" so the expanse opened up below these two strokes is associated by the Japanese with the sense of an infinite expanse or something ""all-encompassing."" 	 	 	Hachi (eight) begins with the sound of the katakana ""ha"", and it´s approximately the same character. 	 	On-Yomi: ハチ   Kun-Yomi: や、や.つ、やっ.つ、よう  	Examples: 八 (や), 八つ (や.つ), 八つ (やっ.つ)"
nine	"nine 	 	九   	   	Lesson: 1   Frame: 9   Strokes: 2   —   Jouyou Grade: 1   JLPT: 5   	Constituents: nine, baseball 	 	If you take care to remember the stroke order of this kanji, you will not have trouble later keeping it distinct from the kanji for power (Frame 922). 	  * As a primitive, we shall use this kanji to mean baseball team or simply baseball. The meaning, of course, is derived from the nine players who make up a team. 	 	Kinda of looks like the kanji of 1　一 with the kanji of 8 八added. So think of it as 　一＋八＝九. 	 	On-Yomi: キュウ、ク   Kun-Yomi: ここの、ここの.つ  	Examples: 九百 (きゅうひゃく), 三拝九拝 (さんはいきゅうはい), 九 (ここの), 九つ (ここの.つ)"
ten	"ten 	 	十   	   	Lesson: 1   Frame: 10   Strokes: 2   —   Jouyou Grade: 1   JLPT: 5   	Constituents: ten, needle 	 	Turn this character 45 degrees either way and you have the x used for the Roman numeral ten. 	  * As a primitive, this character sometimes keeps its meaning of ten and sometimes signifies needle, this latter derived from the kanji for needle (Frame 292). Since the primitive is used in the kanji itself, there is no need to worry about confusing the two. In fact, we shall be following this procedure regularly. 	 	Two needles crossing marks the spot, or you can use the Roman character for ten (rotated 45 degrees). 	 	On-Yomi: ジュウ、ジッ、ジュッ   Kun-Yomi: とお、と  	Examples: 十字架 (じゅうじか), 十文字 (じゅうもんじ), 十 (と), 十 (とお)"
mouth	"mouth 	 	口   	   	Lesson: 1   Frame: 11   Strokes: 3   —   Jouyou Grade: 1   JLPT: 4   	Constituents: mouth 	 	Like several of the first characters we shall learn, the kanji for mouth is a clear pictograph. Since there are no circular shapes in the kanji, the square must be used to depict the circle. 	  * As a primitive, this form also means mouth. Any of the range of possible images that the word suggests - an opening or entrance to a cave, a river, a bottle, or even the largest hole in your head - can be used for the primitive meaning. 	 	Looks like a huge open mouth. 	 	On-Yomi: コウ、ク   Kun-Yomi: くち  	Examples: 口述 (こうじゅつ), 人口 (じんこう), 開口 (かいこう), 口 (くち)"
day	"day 	 	日   	   	Lesson: 1   Frame: 12   Strokes: 4   —   Jouyou Grade: 1   JLPT: 5   	Constituents: day, sun 	 	This kanji is intended to be a pictograph of the sun. Recalling what we said in the previous frame about round forms, it is easy to detect the circle and the big smile that characterize our simplest drawings of the sun - like those yellow badges with the words, ""Have a nice day!"" 	  * Used as a primitive, this kanji can mean sun or day or a tongue wagging in the mouth. This latter meaning, incidentally, derives from an old character outside the standard list meaning something like ""sayeth"" and written almost exactly the same, except that the stroke in the middle does not touch the right side (Frame 620). 	 	Open the window, new day. 	 	On-Yomi: ニチ、ジツ   Kun-Yomi: ひ、-び、-か  	Examples: 日時 (にちじ), 日光 (にっこう), 毎日 (まいにち), 日 (か), 日 (ひ)"
month	"month 	 	月   	   	Lesson: 1   Frame: 13   Strokes: 4   —   Jouyou Grade: 1   JLPT: 5   	Constituents: month, moon, month, flesh, part of the body 	 	This character is actually a picture of the moon, with the two horizontal lines representing the left eye and mouth of the mythical ""man in the moon."" (Actually, the Japanese see a hare in the moon, but it is a little farfetched to find one in the kanji.) And one month, of course, is one cycle of the moon. 	  * As a primitive element, this character can take on the sense of moon, flesh, or part of the body. The reasons for the latter two meanings will be explained in a later chapter. 	 	A month is longer than a day. 	 	On-Yomi: ゲツ、ガツ   Kun-Yomi: つき  	Examples: 月曜 (げつよう), 明月 (めいげつ), 歳月 (さいげつ), 月 (つき)"
rice field	"rice field 	 	田   	   	Lesson: 1   Frame: 14   Strokes: 5   —   Jouyou Grade: 1   JLPT: 4   	Constituents: rice field, brains 	 	Another pictograph, this kanji looks like a bird's-eye view of a rice field divided into four plots. Be careful when writing this character to get the order of the strokes correct. You will find that it follows perfectly the principle stated in frame 4. 	  * When used as a primitive element, the meaning of rice field is most common, but now and again it will take the meaning of brains from the fact that it looks a bit like that tangle of gray matter nestled under our skulls. 	 	A rice field divided into four parts. 	 	On-Yomi: デン   Kun-Yomi: た  	Examples: 田 (た)"
eye	"eye 	 	目   	   	Lesson: 1   Frame: 15   Strokes: 5   —   Jouyou Grade: 1   JLPT: 4   	Constituents: eye 	 	Here again, if we round out the corners of this kanji and curve the middle strokes upwards and downwards respectively, we get something resembling an eye. 	  * As a primitive, the kanji keeps its sense of eye, or more specifically, an eyeball. When placed in the surroundings of a complex kanji, the primitive will sometimes be turned on its side. 	 	There are 3 sections. Imagine the outer two being the whites of your eye. The middle is the pupil. Fill it in with imaginary color. 	 	On-Yomi: モク、ボク   Kun-Yomi: め、-め、ま-  	Examples: 目的 (もくてき), 目前 (もくぜん), 項目 (こうもく), 目 (め)"
old	"old 	 	古   	   	Lesson: 2   Frame: 16   Strokes: 5   —   Jouyou Grade: 2   JLPT: 4   	Constituents: old, tombstone, gravestone, church, ten, needle, mouth 	 	The primitive elements that compose this character are ten and mouth, but you may find it easier to remember it as a pictograph of a tombstone with a cross on top. Just think back to one of those graveyards you have visited, or better still, used to play in as a child, with old inscriptions on the tombstones. This departure from the primitive elements in favor of a pictograph will take place now and again at these early stages, and almost never after that. So you need not worry about cluttering up your memory with too many character ""drawings."" 	  * Used as a primitive element, this kanji keeps its key-word sense of old, but care should be taken to make that abstract notion as graphic as possible. 	 	Tombstone and cross on an old man´s grave. 	 	On-Yomi: コ   Kun-Yomi: ふる.い、ふる-、-ふる.す  	Examples: 古い (ふる.い), 古す (ふる.す)"
I	"I 	 	吾   	   	Lesson: 2   Frame: 17   Strokes: 7   —   Jouyou Grade: Names   JLPT:    	Constituents: I, five, mouth 	 	There are actually a number of kanji for the word I, but the others tend to be more specific than this one. The key word here should be taken in the general psychological sense of the ""perceiving subject."" Now the one place in our bodies that all five senses are concentrated in is the head, which has no less than five mouths: 2 nostrils, 2 ears, and 1 mouth. Hence, five mouths = I. 	 	 	I have 5 senses. 	 	On-Yomi: ゴ   Kun-Yomi: われ、わが-、あ-"
risk	"risk 	 	冒   	   	Lesson: 2   Frame: 18   Strokes: 9   —   Jouyou Grade: JH   JLPT: 1   	Constituents: risk, sun, day, eye 	 	Remember when you were young and your mother told you never to look directly into the sun for fear you might burn out your eyes? Probably you were foolish enough to risk a quick glance once or twice; but just as probably, you passed that bit of folk wisdom on to someone else as you grew older. Here, too, the kanji that has a sun above and an eye right below looking up at it has the meaning of risk (see frame 12). 	 	 	Don´t look at the sun directly with your eyes, it´s risky! 	 	On-Yomi: ボウ   Kun-Yomi: おか.す  	Examples: 冒す (おか.す)"
companion	"companion 	 	朋   	   	Lesson: 2   Frame: 19   Strokes: 8   —   Jouyou Grade: Names   JLPT: 1   	Constituents: companion, moon, month, flesh, part of the body, moon2, month2, flesh2, part of the body2 	 	The first companion that God made, as the Bible story goes, was Eve. Upon seeing her, Adam exclaimed, ""Flesh of my flesh!"" And that is precisely what this character says in so many strokes. 	 	 	My companion and I are like two moons side by side. 	 	On-Yomi: ホウ   Kun-Yomi: とも"
bright	"bright 	 	明   	   	Lesson: 2   Frame: 20   Strokes: 8   —   Jouyou Grade: 2   JLPT: 4   	Constituents: bright, sun, day, moon, month, flesh, part of the body 	 	Among nature's bright lights, there are two that the biblical myth has God set in the sky: the sun to rule over the day and the moon to rule the night. Each of them has come to represent one of the common connotations of this key word: the sun, the bright insight of the clear thinker, and the moon, the bright intuition of the poet and the seer (see frame 13). 	 	 	The sun makes the moon bright. 	 	On-Yomi: メイ、ミョウ、ミン   Kun-Yomi: あ.かり、あか.るい、あか.るむ、あか.らむ、あき.らか、あ.ける、-あ.け、あ.く、あ.くる、あ.かす  	Examples: 明暗 (めいあん), 説明 (せつめい), 鮮明 (せんめい), 明かす (あ.かす), 明かり (あ.かり), 明く (あ.く), 明くる (あ.くる), 明ける (あ.ける), 明らむ (あか.らむ), 明るい (あか.るい), 明るむ (あか.るむ), 明らか (あき.らか)"

You have one mouth making no noise (the choirmaster) and two mouths with wagging tongues (the minimum for a chorus). So think of the key word, chant, as monastery singing and the kanji is yours forever (see frame 11). 	 	 	Someone chanting with their mouth open for two consecutive days. 	 	On-Yomi: ショウ   Kun-Yomi: とな.える  	Examples: 唱える (とな.える)"
sparkle	"sparkle 	 	晶   	   	Lesson: 2   Frame: 22   Strokes: 12   —   Jouyou Grade: JH   JLPT: 1   	Constituents: sparkle, day, sun, day3, sun3 	 	What else can the word sparkle suggest if not a diamond? And if you've ever held a diamond up to the light, you will have noticed how every facet of it becomes like a miniature sun. This kanji is a picture of a tiny sun in three places (that is, ""everywhere""), to give the sense of something that sparkles on all sides. Just like a diamond. In writing the primitive elements three times, note again how the rule for writing given in frame 4 holds true not only for the strokes in each individual element but also for the disposition of the elements in the character as a whole. 	 	 	A diamond sparkles as brightly as three suns. 	 	On-Yomi: ショウ   Kun-Yomi:"
goods	"goods 	 	品   	   	Lesson: 2   Frame: 23   Strokes: 9   —   Jouyou Grade: 3   JLPT: 4   	Constituents: goods, mouth, mouth3 	 	As in the character for sparkle, the triplication of a single element in this character indicates ""everywhere"" or ""heaps of."" When we think of goods in modern industrial society, we think of what has been mass-produced - that is to say, produced for the ""masses"" of open mouths waiting like fledglings in a nest to ""consume"" whatever comes their way. 	 	 	Three boxes of goods are devoured by the hungry mouths of waiting consumers. 	 	On-Yomi: ヒン、ホン   Kun-Yomi: しな  	Examples: 品 (しな)"

Spine connects head and body. 	 	On-Yomi: ロ、リョ   Kun-Yomi: せぼね"
prosperous	"prosperous 	 	昌   	   	Lesson: 2   Frame: 25   Strokes: 8   —   Jouyou Grade: Names   JLPT: 1   	Constituents: prosperous, sun, day, sun2, day2 	 	What we mentioned in the previous two frames about 3 of something meaning ""everywhere"" or ""heaps of"" was not meant to be taken lightly. In this kanji we see two suns, one atop the other, which, if we are not careful, is easily confused in memory with the three suns of sparkle. Focus on the number this way: since we speak of prosperous times as sunny, what could be more prosperous than a sky with two suns in it? Just be sure to actually SEE them there. 	 	 	If you work from Sun UP to Sun DOWN you will be prosperous. 	 	On-Yomi: ショウ   Kun-Yomi: さかん"
early	"early 	 	早   	   	Lesson: 2   Frame: 26   Strokes: 6   —   Jouyou Grade: 1   JLPT: 4   	Constituents: early, sunflower, sun, day, ten, needle 	 	This kanji is actually a picture of the first flower of the day, which we shall, in defiance of botanical science, call the sunflower, since it begins with the element for sun and is held upon a stem with leaves (the pictographic representation of the final two strokes). This time, however, we shall ignore the pictograph and imagine sunflowers with needles for stems, which can be plucked and used to darn your socks. The sense of early is easily remembered if one thinks of the sunflower as the early riser in the garden, because the sun, showing favoritism towards its namesake, shines on it before all the others (see frame 10). 	  * As a primitive element, this kanji takes the meaning of sunflower, which was used to make the abstract key word early more graphic. 	 	The sun up is early, well before ten. 	 	On-Yomi: ソウ、サッ   Kun-Yomi: はや.い、はや、はや-、はや.まる、はや.める、さ-  	Examples: 早期 (そうき), 早晩 (そうばん), 早々に (そうそうに), 早い (はや.い), 早まる (はや.まる), 早める (はや.める)"

If you can picture two seams running down that great red sun, and then imagine it sitting on a baseball bat for a flagpole, you have a slightly irreverent - but not altogether inaccurate - picture of how the sport has caught on in the Land of the Rising Sun. 	 	 	9am carries with it the rising sun.

generation	"generation 	 	世   	   	Lesson: 2   Frame: 28   Strokes: 5   —   Jouyou Grade: 3   JLPT: 4   	Constituents: generation, ten, twenty 	 	We generally consider one generation as a period of thirty (or ten plus ten plus ten) years. If you look at this kanji in its completed form - not in its stroke order - you will see three tens. When writing it, think of the lower horizontal lines as ""addition"" lines written under numbers to add them up. Thus: ten ""plus"" ten ""plus"" ten = thirty. Actually, it's a lot easier doing it with a pencil than reading it in a book. 	 	 	3 tens = generation. 	 	On-Yomi: セイ、セ、ソウ   Kun-Yomi: よ、さんじゅう  	Examples: 世紀 (せいき), 時世 (じせい), 処世 (しょせい), 世 (よ)"

What the kanji says, if you look at it, is that the part of the body that keeps the brain in working order is the stomach. To keep the elements in proper order, when you write this kanji think of the brain as being ""held up"" by the flesh. 	 	 	The rice field is harvested once a month to get food for our stomach.

nightbreak	"nightbreak 	 	旦   	   	Lesson: 2   Frame: 30   Strokes: 5   —   Jouyou Grade: JH   JLPT: 1   	Constituents: nightbreak, sun, one, floor 	 	While we normally refer to the start of the day as ""daybreak,"" Japanese commonly refers to it as the ""opening up of night"" into day. Hence the choice of this rather odd key word, nightbreak. The single stroke at the bottom represents the floor (have a peek again at frame 1) or the horizon over which the sun is poking its head 	 	 	A nightbreak happens when the sun rises over the horizon (floor).

gall bladder	"gall bladder 	 	胆   	   	Lesson: 2   Frame: 31   Strokes: 9   —   Jouyou Grade: JH   JLPT: 1   	Constituents: gallbladder, moon, month, flesh, part of the body, nightbreak, sun, day, one, floor 	 	The pieces in this character should be easily recognizable: on the left, the element for part of the body, and on the right, the character for nightbreak, which we have just met. What all of this has to do with the gall bladder is not immediately clear. But all we need to do is give a slight twist to the traditional biblical advice about not letting the sun set on your anger (which ancient medicine associated with the choler or bile that the gall bladder is supposed to filter out), and change it to ""not letting the night break on your anger"" (or your gall) - and the work of remembering the kanji is done. And the improvement is not a bad piece of advice in its own right, since anger, like so many other things, can often be calmed by letting the sun set on it and then ""sleeping it off."" 	 	 	The moon has a lot of gall sticking around after sunrise. 	 	On-Yomi: タン   Kun-Yomi: きも"
span	"span 	 	亘   	   	Lesson: 2   Frame: 32   Strokes: 6   —   Jouyou Grade: Names   JLPT: 1   	Constituents: span, one, ceiling, sun, day, one, floor 	 	""Sunrise, sunset, sunrise, sunset..."" goes the song of the Fiddler on the Roof. You can almost see the journey of the sun as it moves from one horizon (the floor) to its noonday heights in the sky overhead (ceiling) and then disappears over the other horizon - day after day, marking the span of our lives. 	 	 	The sun spans from horizon to horizon in a day. 	 	On-Yomi: コウ、カン   Kun-Yomi: わた.る、もと.める"

Just have a look at it: a perfect image of a concave lens (remembering, of course, that the kanji square off rounded things), complete with its own little ""cave."" Now all you have to do is learn how to write it. 	 	 	The letter ""U"" is concavely written. 	 	On-Yomi: オウ   Kun-Yomi: くぼ.む、へこ.む、ぼこ"
convex	"convex 	 	凸   	   	Lesson: 2   Frame: 34   Strokes: 5   —   Jouyou Grade: JH   JLPT: 1   	Constituents: convex 	 	Maybe this helps you see how the Japanese have no trouble keeping convex distinct from concave. Note the odd feeling of the third stroke. If it doesn't feel all that strange now, by the time you are done with this book, it will. There are very few times you will have to write it.

The main thing here is to think of ""good old days"" when you hear the key word olden times. The rest will take care of itself. 	 	 	Age 18 = olden times. 	 	On-Yomi: キュウ   Kun-Yomi: ふる.い、もと"

The Japanese refer to themselves by pointing a finger at their nose - giving us an easy way to remember the kanji for oneself. 	  * The same meaning of oneself can be kept when this kanji is used as a primitive element, but you will generally find it better to give it the meaning of nose or nostrils, both because it accords with the story above and because it is the first part of the kanji for nose (Frame 733).

white	"white 	 	白   	   	Lesson: 3   Frame: 37   Strokes: 5   —   Jouyou Grade: 1   JLPT: 5   	Constituents: white, drop, sun, day 	 	The color white is a mixture of all the primary colors, both for pigments and for light, as we see when a prism breaks up the rays of the sun. Hence, a single drop of sun spells white. 	  * As a primitive, this character can either retain its meaning of white or take the more graphic meaning of a white bird or dove. This latter stems from the fact that it appears at the top of the kanji for bird, which we shall get to later (Frame 2091). 	 	A white ray is a drop of sun.

Remember the trouble your mother had getting medicine in your mouth? Chances are it crossed her mind more than once to grab something handy, like your grandfather's walking stick, to pry open your jaws while she performed her duty. Keep the image of getting something in from the outside, and the otherwise abstract sense of this key word should be a lot easier than trying to spoon castor oil into a baby's mouth. 	 	 	Pocky goes in the mouth. 	 	On-Yomi: チュウ   Kun-Yomi: なか、うち、あた.る  	Examples: 中 (なか)"

Now put the elements together by thinking of squeezing two more zeros out of an eyedropper alongside the number ten to make it a thousand. 	 	 	It takes many drops of ten to get to a thousand.

It is easy to see the connection between the idiom and the kanji if you take its image literally: a single tongue being passed around from mouth to mouth. 	 	 	What is in a mouth that permits it to speak a thousand things? Yes, a tongue. 	 	On-Yomi: ゼツ   Kun-Yomi: した  	Examples: 舌 (した)"
measuring box	"measuring box 	 	升   	   	Lesson: 3   Frame: 42   Strokes: 4   —   Jouyou Grade: JH   JLPT: 1   	Constituents: measuring box, thousand, drop, ten, needle 	 	This is the character for the little wooden box that the Japanese use for measuring things, as well as for drinking saké out of. Simply imagine the outside as spiked with a thousand sharp needles, and the quaint little measuring box becomes a drinker's nightmare! Be very careful when you write this character not to confuse it with the writing of thousand. The reason for the difference gives us a chance to clarify another general principle of writing that supersedes the one we mentioned in frame 4: when a single stroke runs vertically through the middle of a character, it is written last. 	 	 	It is a thousand or ten? I need my measuring box. 	 	On-Yomi: ショウ   Kun-Yomi: ます  	Examples: 升 (ます)"
rise up	"rise up 	 	昇   	   	Lesson: 3   Frame: 43   Strokes: 8   —   Jouyou Grade: JH   JLPT: 2   	Constituents: rise up, sun, day, measuring box, thousand, drop, ten, needle 	 	Our image here is made up of two primitive elements: a sun and a measuring box. Just as the sun can be seen rising up in the morning from - where else - the Land of the Rising Sun, this kanji has the sun rising up out of a Japanese measuring box - the ""measuring box of the rising-up sun."" 	 	 	This kanji does not mean ""get up"" or ""awake."" It means rising, like the rising of a salary, or a promotion. STORY: You know that your salary has RISEN UP when your MEASURING BOX has enough dollar bills in it to reach the SUN. 	 	On-Yomi: ショウ   Kun-Yomi: のぼ.る  	Examples: 昇る (のぼ.る)"
round	"round 	 	丸   	   	Lesson: 3   Frame: 44   Strokes: 3   —   Jouyou Grade: 2   JLPT: 2   	Constituents: round, drop, nine, baseball 	 	We speak of ""round numbers,"" or ""rounding a number off,"" meaning to add an insignificant amount to bring it to the nearest 10. For instance, if you add just a wee bit, the tiniest drop, to nine, you end up with a round number. 	  * As a primitive, this element takes the meaning of a fat man. Think of a grotesquely fat man whose paunch so covers the plate that he is always getting hit by the pitch. Hence a round baseball player becomes a fat man. 	 	Nine plus a drop rounds it off to ten! 	 	On-Yomi: ガン   Kun-Yomi: まる、まる.める、まる.い  	Examples: 丸 (まる), 丸い (まる.い), 丸める (まる.める)"

In the old system, it was one-tenth of a shaku (whose kanji we shall meet in frame 1151). The picture, appropriately, represents one drop of a ten (with a hook!). 	  * As a primitive, we shall use this to mean glue or glued to. There is no need to devise a story to remember this, since the primitive will appear so often you would have to struggle hard NOT to remember it. 	 	The decimal system uses drops of ten as a measurement. 	 	On-Yomi: スン   Kun-Yomi:"
specialty	"specialty 	 	専   	   	Lesson: 3   Frame: 47   Strokes: 9   —   Jouyou Grade: 6   JLPT: 2   	Constituents: specialty, ten, needle, rice field, brains, glue 	 	Ten . . . rice fields . . . glue. That is how one would read the primitive elements of this kanji from top to bottom. Now if we make a simple sentence out of these elements, we get: ""Ten rice fields glued together."" A specialty, of course, refers to one's special ""field"" of endeavor or competence. In fact, few people remain content with a single specialty and usually extend themselves in other fields as well. This is how we come to get the picture of ten fields glued together to represent a specialty. 	 	 	After you have chosen your 10 fields of study, measure how good you are at each to find out your specialty. 	 	On-Yomi: セン   Kun-Yomi: もっぱ.ら  	Examples: 専ら (もっぱ.ら)"

Think of a Dr. who is a specialist with a needle (an acupuncturist) and let the drop at the top represent the period at the end of Dr. In principle we are trying to avoid this kind of device, which plays on abstract grammatical conventions; but I think you will agree, after you have had occasion to use the right side of this kanji in forming other kanji, that the exception is merited in this case. 	  * The primitive form of this kanji eliminates the needle on the left and gets the meaning of an acupuncturist. 	 	Ten specialties grants you the title of Dr. with a dot. 	 	On-Yomi: ハク、バク   Kun-Yomi:   	Examples: 博識 (はくしき), 博覧 (はくらん), 博士号 (はくしごう)"

Note how the movement from top to bottom (the movement in which the kanji are written) is also the order of the elements which make up our story and of the key word itself: first divining rod, then mouth. This will not always be possible, but where it is, memory has almost no work at all to do. 	 	 	Fortune-telling: using a mouth as a divining rod.

But the characters do not follow that custom, so we have to choose something else, easily remembered. The primitives show a magic wand standing above a floor - ""magically,"" you might say. Anyway, go right on to the next frame, since the two belong together and are best remembered as a unit, just as the words above and below suggest each other. 	 	 	A magic wand standing on above the floor. 	 	On-Yomi: ジョウ、ショウ、シャン   Kun-Yomi: うえ、-うえ、うわ-、かみ、あ.げる、-あ.げる、あ.がる、-あ.がる、あ.がり、-あ.がり、のぼ.る、のぼ.り、のぼ.せる、のぼ.す、よ.す  	Examples: 上旬 (じょうじゅん), 上昇 (じょうしょう), 地上 (ちじょう), 上がる (あ.がる), 上げる (あ.げる), 上 (うえ), 上 (かみ), 上す (のぼ.す), 上せる (のぼ.せる), 上る (のぼ.る)"

In addition to giving us two new kanji, the two shapes given in this and the preceding frame also serve to fix the use of the primitives for ceiling and floor, by drawing our attention successively to the line standing above and below the primitive element to which it is related. 	 	 	Roots are below the ground. 	 	On-Yomi: カ、ゲ   Kun-Yomi: した、しも、もと、さ.げる、さ.がる、くだ.る、くだ.り、くだ.す、-くだ.す、くだ.さる、お.ろす、お.りる  	Examples: 下流 (かりゅう), 下降 (かこう), 落下 (らっか), 下りる (お.りる), 下ろす (お.ろす), 下さる (くだ.さる), 下す (くだ.す), 下る (くだ.る), 下がる (さ.がる), 下げる (さ.げる), 下 (した), 下 (しも), 下 (もと)"

So all you need to do - given the primitives of a magic wand and a sunflower - is to think of the world's most eminent magician as one who uses a sunflower for a magic wand (like a flower-child who goes around turning the world into peace and love). 	 	 	The most eminent magician is he who learned to use his magic wand early in life. 	 	On-Yomi: タク   Kun-Yomi:"

If you can think of the moon tilting over to spill mist on your garden, you should have no trouble remembering which of all the elements in this story are to serve as primitives for constructing the character. 	 	 	There is mist as the moon fades away in the morning. 	 	On-Yomi: チョウ   Kun-Yomi: あさ  	Examples: 朝 (あさ)"

For instance, we can think of the expression ""it's the only one of its kind."" Then we imagine a barker at a side-show advertising some strange pac-manlike creature he has inside his tent, with only a gigantic mouth and two wee animal legs. 	 	 	Imagine an animal with only a mouth and legs. 	 	On-Yomi: シ   Kun-Yomi: ただ"

But that might not help you recall later just how many ridges to put on the shell. Better to imagine a freakish shellfish with a single, gigantic eye roaming the beaches on its slender little legs, scaring the wits out of the sunbathers. 	  * When used as a primitive, in addition to shells, the meanings oyster and clam will often come in handy. 	 	Eye thought I saw a shellfish legging it down the beach! 	 	On-Yomi: バイ   Kun-Yomi: かい  	Examples: 貝 (かい)"

After all, the clam and the oyster are incapable of walking upright. It would take a magician with his wand to pull off such a feat - which is precisely what we have in this kanji. 	 	 	A magic wand is needed to make a clam stand upright. 	 	On-Yomi: テイ   Kun-Yomi: さだ"

Simple. Just remember the advice new employees get about keeping their mouths shut and doing their job, and then make that more graphic by picturing an office building full of white collar workers scurrying around with clams pinched to their mouths. 	 	 	An employee (member of the company) has to clam up his mouth if he wants keep the job! 	 	On-Yomi: イン   Kun-Yomi:"

Surely, somewhere in your experience, there is a vivid image just waiting to be dragged up to help you remember this character.... 	 	 	As a primitive, this is Mike Wazowski from Monsters Inc. (the giant eyeball with legs...) Makes for easy stories later on. 	 	On-Yomi: ケン   Kun-Yomi: み.る、み.える、み.せる  	Examples: 見える (み.える), 見せる (み.せる), 見る (み.る)"

Western mythical imagination has old ""Father Time"" leaning on his sickle with a newborn babe crawling around his legs, the idea being that the circle of birth and-death goes on. This is the first of three times that the kanji for olden times will appear as a primitive element in another kanji, so try to make the most of it. 	 	 	In the olden times, a newborn babe came out legs first. 	 	On-Yomi: ジ、ニ、ゲイ   Kun-Yomi: こ、-こ、-っこ  	Examples: 児童 (じどう), 幼児 (ようじ), 優良児 (ゆうりょうじ)"

It talks about how all things were made, and tells us that when the Creator came to humanity she made two of them, man and woman. While we presume she made two of every other animal as well, we are not told as much. Hence we need only two and a pair of human legs come to the kanji that means beginning. 	 	 	In the beginning were just two who walked on human legs. 	 	On-Yomi: ゲン、ガン   Kun-Yomi: もと  	Examples: 元素 (げんそ), 元気 (げんき), 多元 (たげん), 元 (もと)"
page	"page 	 	頁   	   	Lesson: 4   Frame: 64   Strokes: 9   —   Jouyou Grade: Names   JLPT:    	Constituents: page, one, ceiling, drop, shellfish, clam, oyster, eye, animal legs, eight 	 	What we have to do here is turn a shellfish into a page of a book. The one at the top tells us that we only get a rather short book, in fact only one page. Imagine a title printed on the shell of an oyster, let us say ""Pearl of Wisdom,"" and then open the quaint book to its one and only page, on which you find a single, radiant drop of wisdom, one of the masterpiece poems of nature. 	  * As a primitive, this kanji takes the unrelated meaning of a head (preferably one detached from its body), derived from the character for head (Frame 1549). 	 	A shellfish carrying a page balanced on its head. 	 	On-Yomi: ケツ   Kun-Yomi: ぺえじ、おおがい、かしら"
stubborn	"stubborn 	 	頑   	   	Lesson: 4   Frame: 65   Strokes: 13   —   Jouyou Grade: JH   JLPT: 1   	Constituents: stubborn, beginning, two, human legs, head, page, one, ceiling, drop, shellfish, clam, oyster, eye, animal legs, eight 	 	This character refers to the blockheaded, persistent stubbornness of one who sticks to an idea or a plan just the way it was at the beginning, without letting anything that comes up along the way alter things in the least. The explanation makes ""sense,"" but is hard to remember because the word ""beginning ""is too abstract. Back up to the image we used two frames ago - Adam and Eve in their Eden - and try again: The root of all stubbornness goes back to the beginning, with two brothers each stubbornly defending his own way of life and asking their God to bless it favorably. Abel stuck to agriculture, Cain to animal-raising. Picture these two with their giant, swelled heads, each vying for the favors of heaven, a stubborn grimace on their faces. No wonder something unfortunate happened! 	 	 	A stubborn person in the beginning gets something into their head and can´t change their mind. 	 	On-Yomi: ガン   Kun-Yomi: かたく"

A drop of breeze is naught but a mediocre wind. 	 	On-Yomi: ボン、ハン   Kun-Yomi: およ.そ、おうよ.そ、すべ.て  	Examples: 凡人 (ぼんじん), 凡百 (ぼんひゃく), 平凡 (へいぼん)"

Now imagine two oysters engaged in shell-to-shell combat, the one who is defeated being bound and gagged with seaweed, the victor towering triumphantly over it. The bound shellfish thus becomes the symbol for defeat. 	 	 	Tied up, the shellfish had to accept defeat! 	 	On-Yomi: フ   Kun-Yomi: ま.ける、ま.かす、お.う  	Examples: 負う (お.う), 負かす (ま.かす), 負ける (ま.ける)"
ten thousand	"ten thousand 	 	万   	   	Lesson: 4   Frame: 68   Strokes: 3   —   Jouyou Grade: 2   JLPT: 5   	Constituents: ten thousand, one, ceiling, bound up 	 	Japanese counts higher numbers in units of ten thousand, unlike the West, which advances according to units of one thousand. (Thus, for instance, 40,000 would be read ""four ten-thousands"" by a Japanese.) Given that the comma is used in larger numbers to bind up a numerical unit of one thousand, the elements for one and bound up naturally come to form ten thousand. The order of strokes here needs special attention, both because it falls outside the general principles we have learned already, and because it involves writing the element for bound up in an order opposite to the one we learned. If it is any consolation, this exception is consistent every time these three strokes come together. 	 	 	I bound ten thousand dollars together and hid it under the floor.

After all, a phrase is nothing more than a number of words bound up tightly and neatly so that they will fit in your mouth. 	 	 	Some Japanese phrases are difficult to wrap your mouth around. 	 	On-Yomi: ク   Kun-Yomi:   	Examples: 句 (く)"

A day's skiing or sailing makes them rough and dry, and in need of a good soft cream to soothe the burn. So whenever a part of the body gets exposed to the wind, its texture is affected. (If it is any help, the Latin word hiding inside texture connotes how something is ""to the touch."") 	 	 	When you expose your flesh to the wind it gets textured: goosebumps!

So we resurrect the classical phrase, decameron, whose connotations the tales of Boccaccio have done much to enrich. Actually, it refers to a journey of ten days taken by a band of people - that is, a group of people bound together for the days of the decameron. 	 	 	Hesig should be BOUND for a DAY (or maybe 10 days - a decameron) for calling this Kanji DECAMERON. See martyrdom (#809). 	 	On-Yomi: ジュン、シュン   Kun-Yomi:"

I managed to hit the bull´s eye by throwing my white ladle. 	 	On-Yomi: テキ   Kun-Yomi: まと  	Examples: 的 (まと)"

Together they bring to mind the picture of a moose-head hanging on the den wall, with its great horns and long nose. Now while we would speak of cutting off a moose's ""head"" to hang on the wall, the Japanese speak of cutting off its neck. It's all a matter of how you look at it. Anyway, if you let the word neck conjure up the image of a moose with a very l-o-n-g neck hanging over the fireplace, whose horns you use for a coat-rack and whose nose has spigots left and right for scotch and water, you should have no trouble with the character. Here we get a good look at what we mentioned when we first introduced the element for horns: that they can never be left floating free and require an extra horizontal stroke to prevent that from happening, as is the case here. 	 	 	The V shape is your neck on top of your collar bone, or the straight line. Yourself, or the rest of your body is below that! 	 	On-Yomi: シュ   Kun-Yomi: くび  	Examples: 首 (くび)"
fish guts	"fish guts 	 	乙   	   	Lesson: 5   Frame: 75   Strokes: 1   —   Jouyou Grade: JH   JLPT: 1   	Constituents: fishguts, fishhook 	 	The kanji shown here actually represents the ""second"" position in the old Chinese zodiac, which the Japanese still use as an alternate way of enumeration, much the same way that English will revert to Roman numerals. Among its many other meanings are ""pure,"" ""tasteful,"" ""quaint,"" and - get this! - fish guts. Since it is a pictograph of a fishhook, it should not be hard to associate it with the key word. 	  * We will keep fishhook as the primitive meaning. Its shape will rarely be quite the same as that of the kanji. When it appears at the bottom of another primitive, it is straightened out, almost as if the weight of the upper element had bent it out of shape. And when it appears to the right of another element, the short horizontal line that gets the shape started is omitted and it is stretched out and narrowed, all for reasons of space and aesthetics. Examples follow. 	 	This is a fish hook, that pulls out the fishguts. 	 	On-Yomi: オツ、イツ   Kun-Yomi: おと-、きのと"
riot	"riot 	 	乱   	   	Lesson: 5   Frame: 76   Strokes: 7   —   Jouyou Grade: 6   JLPT: 2   	Constituents: riot, tongue, thousand, drop, ten, needle, mouth, fishhook 	 	In a riot, manners are laid aside and tempers get short, even in so courtesy-conscious a land as Japan. This kanji shows what happens to a rioting tongue: it gets ""barbed"" like a fishhook, and sets to attacking the opposition, to hook them as it were. 	 	 	The riot police broke up the riot by dragging the rioters away by their tongues with fishooks. 	 	On-Yomi: ラン、ロン   Kun-Yomi: みだ.れる、みだ.る、みだ.す、みだ、おさ.める、わた.る  	Examples: 乱す (みだ.す), 乱れる (みだ.れる)"

Together they represent the eye of a needle. Below them is a fishhook that has been straightened out and its barb removed so that it can pass through the eye of the needle. 	 	 	If you get a needle in your eye that is hooked in there, get to a hospital straightaway. 	 	On-Yomi: チョク、ジキ、ジカ   Kun-Yomi: ただ.ちに、なお.す、-なお.す、なお.る、なお.き、す.ぐ  	Examples: 直立 (ちょくりつ), 直接 (ちょくせつ), 実直 (じっちょく), 直ちに (ただ.ちに), 直す (なお.す), 直る (なお.る)"

If you can think of a table full of carpenter's tools of all sorts, each equipped with its own eye so that it can keep a watch over what you are doing with it, you won't have trouble later keeping the primitive and the kanji apart. 	 	 	Keep an eye on your tools while you work at the table. 	 	On-Yomi: グ   Kun-Yomi: そな.える、つぶさ.に"

A compass is a tool with a needle on top that points to true north. 	 	On-Yomi: シン   Kun-Yomi: ま、ま-、まこと  	Examples: 真 (ま)"
craft	"craft 	 	工   	   	Lesson: 5   Frame: 80   Strokes: 3   —   Jouyou Grade: 2   JLPT: 4   	Constituents: craft, artificial 	 	The pictograph of an I beam, like the kind used in heavy construction work on buildings and bridges, gives us the character for craft in general. 	  * As a primitive element, the key word retains the meaning of craft and also takes on the related meanings of I beam and artificial. 	 	I consider craft to be one of the harder primitives to use in stories so I´ve personified it as Bender the crafty robot from Futurama who was designed to bend I-beams. 	 	On-Yomi: コウ、ク、グ   Kun-Yomi:   	Examples: 工場 (こうじょう), 加工 (かこう), 人工 (じんこう)"

Conveniently, the left has traditionally been considered the ""sinister"" side, where dark and occult crafts are cultivated. Note how the second stroke droops over to the left and is longer than the first. 	 	 	The LEFT side of my brain posesses the faculties needed for logical crafts, like engineering. 	 	On-Yomi: サ、シャ   Kun-Yomi: ひだり  	Examples: 左 (ひだり)"

Imagine a little mouth hanging down by your side - like a little voice of conscience - telling you the right thing to do. Here the second stroke should reach out to the right and be drawn slightly longer than the first. 	 	 	The right hand is for putting food in your mouth. (The other hand is for ass-wiping!).

Think of it as an evil spirit in possession of one's soul, who can be exorcized only by allowing fresh meat to hang by one's side until it begins to putrefy and stink so bad that the demon departs. Take careful note of the stroke order. 	 	 	Possessed by the Earth´s gravity, the moon stays by its side. 	 	On-Yomi: ユウ、ウ   Kun-Yomi: あ.る  	Examples: 有益 (ゆうえき), 所有 (しょゆう), 特有 (とくゆう), 有 (ある)"

Keep the connotation of the last frame for the word possess, and now expand your image of shells to include the ancient value they had as money (a usage that will come in very helpful later on). Now one who is possessed by shells is likely to abandon any higher principles to acquire more and more wealth. These are the easiest ones to bribe with a few extra shells. 	 	 	To bribe someone, money is a necessary possession. 	 	On-Yomi: ワイ   Kun-Yomi: まかな.う  	Examples: 賄う (まかな.う)"
tribute	"tribute 	 	貢   	   	Lesson: 5   Frame: 85   Strokes: 10   —   Jouyou Grade: JH   JLPT: 1   	Constituents: tribute, craft, shellfish, clam, oyster, eye, animal legs, eight 	 	A tribute has a kind of double-meaning in English: honor paid freely and money collected by coercion. Simply because a ruler bestows a noble name on a deed is hardly any consolation to the masses who must part with their hard-earned money. Little wonder that this ancient craft of getting money by calling it a tribute has given way to a name closer to how it feels to those who pay it: a tax. 	 	 	This next song is a TRIBUTE to a little SHELLFISH friend of mine who was tragically crushed by an I-shaped table.. 	 	On-Yomi: コウ、ク   Kun-Yomi: みつ.ぐ  	Examples: 貢献 (こうけん), 貢 (みつぐ)"

When we think of a paragraph, we immediately think of a heading device to break a text into parts. (Think of the elaborate heads often seen at the start of medieval manuscripts and the task becomes easier still.) Just where and how to do it belongs to the writer's craft. Hence, we define paragraphing as the ""heading craft"" to remember this character. 	 	 	To write a paragraph is the craft of grouping sentences on a page. 	 	On-Yomi: コウ   Kun-Yomi: うなじ"
sword	"sword 	 	刀   	   	Lesson: 5   Frame: 87   Strokes: 2   —   Jouyou Grade: 2   JLPT: 1   	Constituents: sword, dagger 	 	Although this character no longer looks very much like a sword, it does have some resemblance to the handle of the sword. This is to our advantage, in that it helps us keep make a distinction between two primitive elements based on this kanji. 	  * In the form of the kanji, this primitive means a dagger. When it appears to the right of another element, it is commonly stretched out and takes the sense of a great and flashing saber, a meaning it gets from a character we shall learn later (Frame 1801). 	 	This SWORD is so sharp, it can cut the top part of カ off in カタナ. 	 	On-Yomi: トウ   Kun-Yomi: かたな、そり  	Examples: 刀 (かたな)"
blade	"blade 	 	刃   	   	Lesson: 5   Frame: 88   Strokes: 3   —   Jouyou Grade: JH   JLPT: 1   	Constituents: blade, drop, sword, dagger 	 	Think of using a dagger as a razor blade, and it shouldn't be hard to imagine cutting yourself. See the little drop of blood clinging to the blade? 	 	 	The part of a sword where a drop of blood can usually be found is the blade. 	 	On-Yomi: ジン、ニン   Kun-Yomi: は、やいば、き.る  	Examples: 刃 (は)"
cut	"cut 	 	切   	   	Lesson: 5   Frame: 89   Strokes: 4   —   Jouyou Grade: 2   JLPT: 4   	Constituents: cut, seven, diced, sword, dagger 	 	To the right we see the dagger and next to it the number seven whose primitive meaning we decided would be diced (Frame 7). It is hard to think of cutting anything with a knife without imagining one of those skillful Japanese chefs. Only let us say that he has had too much to drink at a party, grabs a dagger lying on the mantelpiece and starts dicing up everything insight, starting with the hors d'oeuvres and going on to the furniture and the carpets.... 	 	 	The seven samurai used their swords to cut their opponents.

seduce	"seduce 	 	召   	   	Lesson: 5   Frame: 90   Strokes: 5   —   Jouyou Grade: JH   JLPT: 2   	Constituents: seduce, sword, dagger, mouth 	 	A sword or dagger posed over a mouth is how the character for ""beckoning"" is written. The related but less tame key word seduce was chosen because it seemed to fit better with the - how shall we put it? - Freudian implications of the kanji. (Observe if you will that it is not sure whether the long slender object is seducing the small round one or vice versa.) 	  * The primitive meaning remains the same: seduce. Just be sure to associate it with a very concrete image. 	 	A man is easily seduced by a mouth to his ""sword."". 	 	On-Yomi: ショウ   Kun-Yomi: め.す  	Examples: 召す (め.す)"

Shining is the sun´s seduction. 	 	On-Yomi: ショウ   Kun-Yomi:"

Think of digging for clams in an area where there are gaming rules governing how large a find has to be before you can keep it. So you take your trusty saber, which you have carefully notched like a yardstick, crack open a clam and then measure the poor little beastie to see if it is as long as the rules say it has to be. 	 	 	When you have both money and the power of the sword, you can make the rules. 	 	On-Yomi: ソク   Kun-Yomi: のっと.る"

The great and flashing saber to the right (its usual location, so you need not worry about where to put it from now on) and the wealth on the left combine to create an image of dividing one's property to give a share to one's vice-wealth holder. 	 	 	The wealthy guy with the sword standing next to the king, that´s the vice-roy who does all the dirty work. 	 	On-Yomi: フク   Kun-Yomi:"

They were constant companions, like the cowboy of the Old West and his six-shooter. This character depicts what must have been the height of separation-anxiety for a samurai: to be bound up with a rope and unable to get at his saber leaning only a few feet away from him. Look at that mouth bellowing out for shame and sorrow! Note the order in which the element for tied up is written - just as it had been with the character for ten thousand. 	 	 	I don´t know about you but to me this seems like someone´s head is about to be separated from his body. You can see he´s kneeling and his mouth is wide open gasping for the last breath he will ever take. 	 	On-Yomi: ベツ   Kun-Yomi: わか.れる、わ.ける  	Examples: 別れる (わか.れる)"
street	"street 	 	丁   	   	Lesson: 5   Frame: 95   Strokes: 2   —   Jouyou Grade: 3   JLPT: 1   	Constituents: street, street, nail, spike 	 	The picture here is of a street sign on a long pole: Hollywood and Vine, if you please, or any street that immediately conjure sup the image of a street sign to you. 	  * Used as a primitive, we change the meaning of the key word and take the shape to signify a nail or a spike. Should it happen, on reviewing, that you find the pictographs get jumbled, then think of jerking a street sign out of the ground and using it as a nail to repair your garage roof. 	 	Today, the program ""Sesame Street"" is brought to you by the letter ""T"". 	 	On-Yomi: チョウ、テイ、チン、トウ、チ   Kun-Yomi: ひのと  	Examples: 丁数 (ちょうかず), 落丁 (らくちょう), 二丁目 (にちょうめ)"
village	"village 	 	町   	   	Lesson: 5   Frame: 96   Strokes: 7   —   Jouyou Grade: 1   JLPT: 4   	Constituents: village, rice field, brains, street, nail, spike 	 	Street signs standing at the corner of the rice fields depict the village limits. (Remember what was said earlier: when used as a primitive, a kanji may either take its primitive meaning or revert to the original meaning of its key word.) 	 	 	Actually this means town, like one that has lots of streets and is surrounded by all the rice fields. 	 	On-Yomi: チョウ   Kun-Yomi: まち  	Examples: 町 (まち)"

See the determined little locomotive huffing and puffing up the mountain - ""I think I can, I think I can...."" - spitting railroad spikes out of its mouth as it chews up the line to the top. 	 	 	A mouth on the street asking for things: ""Can I get some help?! Can I get directions, Can I have some money? Can you please speak English?!"". 	 	On-Yomi: カ、コク   Kun-Yomi: -べ.き"

Reading off the two primitive elements in the order of their writing, we have: nail . . . head. As in ""hitting the nail on the head."" Now one presumes that most people can handle metaphors, but if you were to run into a dimwit working in a hardware store who only knew the literal meaning of things, and were to ask him, in your best Japanese, to place on your head a nail, he might miss the point and cause you considerable torment. 	 	 	If I put a street sign on my head what do I get ? A place on the head ! 	 	On-Yomi: チョウ   Kun-Yomi: いただ.く、いただき  	Examples: 頂く (いただ.く), 頂 (いただき)"
child	"child 	 	子   	   	Lesson: 6   Frame: 99   Strokes: 3   —   Jouyou Grade: 1   JLPT: 5   	Constituents: child 	 	This kanji is a pictograph of a child wrapped up in one of those handy cocoons that Japanese mothers fix to their backs to carry around young children who cannot get around by themselves. The first stroke is like a wee head popping out for air; the second shows the body and legs all wrapped up; and the final stroke shows the arms sticking out to cling to the mother's neck. 	  * As a primitive, the meaning of child is retained, though you might imagine a little older child, able to run around and get into more mischief. 	 	A child who is ten will still ask for his ma (top looks a bit like katakana ma). 	 	On-Yomi: シ、ス、ツ   Kun-Yomi: こ、-こ、ね  	Examples: 子孫 (しそん), 女子 (じょし), 帽子 (ぼうし), 子 (こ)"

Once a child has seen a dentist holding the x-rays up to the light and heard that ominous word cavity, even though it is not likely to know that the word means ""hole"" until it is much older, it will not be long before those two syllables get associated with the drill and that row of shiny hooks the dentist uses to torture people who are too small to fight back. 	 	 	The child´s arms flailed around at the sight of the hooked tool the dentist was going to use to fill his cavity. 	 	On-Yomi: コウ   Kun-Yomi: あな"

The only difference is that the ""arms"" have been left off (actually, only tucked inside). Thus a child with its arms wrapped up into the back-sack is the picture of a job successfully completed. 	 	 	The experiment was a complete failure! The child was made without any arms!

woman	"woman 	 	女   	   	Lesson: 6   Frame: 102   Strokes: 3   —   Jouyou Grade: 1   JLPT: 5   	Constituents: woman 	 	You have probably seen somewhere the form of a squatting woman drawn behind this character, with two legs at the bottom, two arms (the horizontal line) and the head poking out the top. A little farfetched, until you draw the character and feel the grace and flow of the three simple strokes. Remembering the kanji is easy; being able to write it beautifully is another thing. 	  * The primitive meaning is the same: woman. 	 	To remember the order of strokes, remember a female ninja is called a ""kunoichi"". That is, く(hiragana) ノ(katakana) 一(kanji, ichi=one). 	 	On-Yomi: ジョ、ニョ、ニョウ   Kun-Yomi: おんな、め  	Examples: 女子 (じょし), 女流 (じょりゅう), 少女 (しょうじょ), 女人 (にょにん), 天女 (てんにょ), 善男善女 (ぜんなんぜんにょ), 女 (おんな), 女 (め)"
fond	"fond 	 	好   	   	Lesson: 6   Frame: 103   Strokes: 6   —   Jouyou Grade: 4   JLPT: 3   	Constituents: fond, woman, child 	 	The phrase ""to be fond of someone"" has a natural gentleness about it, and lends a tenderness to the sense of touching by giving us the related term ""to fondle."" The character likens it to a woman fondling her child. 	 	 	A woman is fond of her child. 	 	On-Yomi: コウ   Kun-Yomi: この.む、す.く、よ.い、い.い  	Examples: 好む (この.む), 好く (す.く)"
likeness	"likeness 	 	如   	   	Lesson: 6   Frame: 104   Strokes: 6   —   Jouyou Grade: JH   JLPT: 1   	Constituents: likeness, woman, mouth 	 	Pardon me if I revert to the venerable old Dr. Freud again, but his eye for symbolism is often helpful to appreciate things that more earthy imaginations once accepted more freely but that we have learned to cover over with a veneer of etiquette. For instance, the fact that things like the mouth of a cave served as natural ritual substitutes for the opening through which a woman gives birth. Hence, in order to be reborn as an adult, one may have to pass through the psychological equivalent of the womb, that is, something that bears a likeness to the opening of the woman from whom you were born. 	 	 	Women share a common likeness. Their mouths are always open, whining about this and that. 	 	On-Yomi: ジョ、ニョ   Kun-Yomi: ごと.し  	Examples: 欠如 (けつじょ), 突如 (とつじょ), 躍如 (やくじょ)"
mama	"mama 	 	母   	   	Lesson: 6   Frame: 105   Strokes: 5   —   Jouyou Grade: 2   JLPT: 5   	Constituents: mama, mother, breasts 	 	Look closely at this kanji and you will find the outline of the kanji for woman in it, the second stroke of which has been expanded to make space for the two breasts that make her a mama. Likening this sound to a baby nursing at its mother's breast has afforded some scholars of comparative linguistics a way to explain the presence of the same word across a wide range of language groups. 	  * As a primitive we shall add the meaning of breasts in accord with the explanation given above. Take careful note of the fact that the form is altered slightly when this kanji serves as a primitive, the final two dots joining together to form a longer stroke. An example follows in the next frame. 	 	The two breasts of a momma who breastfeeds. 	 	On-Yomi: ボ   Kun-Yomi: はは、も  	Examples: 母 (はは)"
pierce	"pierce 	 	貫   	   	Lesson: 6   Frame: 106   Strokes: 11   —   Jouyou Grade: JH   JLPT: 1   	Constituents: pierce, mama, mother, breasts, oyster, shellfish, clam, oyster, eye, animal legs, eight 	 	If one is asked to think of associations for the word pierce, among the first to come to mind is that of piercing one's ears to hold earrings, a quite primitive form of self-mutilation that has survived into the 21st century. The kanji here is read, top to bottom: mama . . . oyster. All you need to do is imagine piercing an ear so that it can hold a mother-of-pearl (actually, a mama-of-pearl) you have just wrested from an oyster. 	 	 	Ariel the Little Mermaid´s clamshell bra was held to her breasts by piercings. 	 	On-Yomi: カン   Kun-Yomi: つらぬ.く、ぬ.く、ぬき  	Examples: 貫く (つらぬ.く)"

The large mouth on top and the human legs below almost jump off the page as a caricature of elder brother, the one with the big mouth (or if you prefer a kinder image, the one who ""has the say"" among all the children). 	  * As a primitive this character will take the meaning of teenager, in accord with the familiar image of the big mouth and the gangling, clumsy legs. 	 	My elder brother was basically a mouth on legs when he was a teenager. 	 	On-Yomi: ケイ、キョウ   Kun-Yomi: あに  	Examples: 兄事 (あにこと), 父兄 (ふけい), 義兄 (ぎあに), 兄 (あに)"

The needle on top indicates one of the major problems confronting the teenager growing up in today's world: drugs. Many of them will fall under the shadow of the needle at some time during those tender years, but only when a whole generation rises up and decides that ""We Shall Overcome"" the plague, will the needle cease to hangover their heads, as it does in this character.

That meaning comes in the next frame. Here little means ""small"" or ""tiny."" The image is one of three little drops, the first of which (the one in the middle) is written larger so that the kanji has some shape to it. The point of writing it three times is to rub the point in: little, little, nothing but little. 	  * The primitive of the same shape keeps the same meaning. Written above a horizontal line, its form is slightly altered, the last two strokes turning inwards. 	 	A little penguin with its wings at its side. 	 	On-Yomi: ショウ   Kun-Yomi: ちい.さい、こ-、お-、さ-  	Examples: 小 (お), 小 (こ), 小さい (ちい.さい)"
few	"few 	 	少   	   	Lesson: 7   Frame: 111   Strokes: 4   —   Jouyou Grade: 2   JLPT: 4   	Constituents: few, little, small, drop 	 	First we need to look at the fourth stroke, the drop at the bottom that has been extended into a longer diagonal stroke leaning left. This happens because a single, isolated drop will NEVER appear beneath its relative primitive in its normal size, for fear it would drop off and get lost. As for the meaning, let the tiny drop indicate a further belittling of what is already little - thus making it a few of something little. 	 	 	Only a few people can make an ugly face like that. 	 	On-Yomi: ショウ   Kun-Yomi: すく.ない、すこ.し  	Examples: 少ない (すく.ない), 少し (すこ.し)"

It should not be too hard to locate the two legs and outstretched arms. 	  * As a primitive, we need a different meaning, since the element representing the human person will come up later. Therefore, this shape will become a large dog or, if you prefer, a St. Bernard dog. In frame 253 we will explain why this choice was made. 	 	A person stretching their arms and legs to look large and scare a bear away. 	 	On-Yomi: ダイ、タイ   Kun-Yomi: おお-、おお.きい、-おお.いに  	Examples: 大小 (だいしょう), 大胆 (だいたん), 拡大 (かくだい), 大 (おお), 大いに (おお.いに), 大きい (おお.きい)"

Here we have two moons (three of them would take us back to the beginning of time, which is further than we want to go), lacking the final stroke because they are partially hidden behind the clouds of time. 	 	 	Two evenings too many! 	 	On-Yomi: タ   Kun-Yomi: おお.い、まさ.に、まさ.る  	Examples: 多い (おお.い)"
evening	"evening 	 	夕   	   	Lesson: 7   Frame: 114   Strokes: 3   —   Jouyou Grade: 1   JLPT: 4   	Constituents: evening 	 	Just as the word evening adds a touch of formality or romanticism to the ordinary word ""night,"" so the kanji for evening takes the ordinary looking moon in the night sky and has a cloud pass over it (as we saw in the last frame). 	  * The primitive keeps the same meaning and connotation as the kanji. 	 	The evening is young, the moon is not full. 	 	On-Yomi: セキ   Kun-Yomi: ゆう  	Examples: 夕 (ゆう)"
eventide	"eventide 	 	汐   	   	Lesson: 7   Frame: 115   Strokes: 6   —   Jouyou Grade: Names   JLPT: 1   	Constituents: eventide, water, water droplets, water pistol, evening 	 	In the next lesson we will meet the character for morning-tide and the element for drops of water. Meantime we have a perfect blend of picture and idea in this kanji to play on the English word for nightfall, eventide: drops of water inching their way up the shore in the evening. 	 	 	Eventide is just another word for evening, and it has the word tide in it which we associate with water. 	 	On-Yomi: セキ   Kun-Yomi: しお、うしお、せい"
outside	"outside 	 	外   	   	Lesson: 7   Frame: 116   Strokes: 5   —   Jouyou Grade: 2   JLPT: 5   	Constituents: outside, evening, magic wand, augury 	 	On the left, the primitive for evening, and on the right, that for the magic wand. Now, as every magician worth his abracadabra knows, bringing your magic wand out into the evening air makes your magic much more powerful than if you were to stay indoors. Hence, evening and magic wand takes you naturally outside. 	 	 	A young magician likes to practice outside in the evening with his magic wand (as opposed to the old magician who wakes early to practice with his wand in eminent (#51)). 	 	On-Yomi: ガイ、ゲ   Kun-Yomi: そと、ほか、はず.す、はず.れる、と-  	Examples: 外出 (がいしゅつ), 海外 (かいがい), 除外 (じょがい), 外 (そと), 外す (はず.す), 外れる (はず.れる), 外 (ほか)"

It is an impressive naming custom and fits in tidily with the way this character is constructed: evening . . . mouth. At evening time, a mouth pronounces the name that will accompany one throughout life. 	 	 	In the evening, when it becomes dark, open your mouth to say your name so that people can recognise you. 	 	On-Yomi: メイ、ミョウ   Kun-Yomi: な、-な  	Examples: 名誉 (めいよ), 氏名 (しめい), 有名 (ゆうめい), 名 (な)"
stone	"stone 	 	石   	   	Lesson: 7   Frame: 118   Strokes: 5   —   Jouyou Grade: 1   JLPT: 3   	Constituents: stone, cliff, mouth 	 	With a mouth under a cliff, what else could we have here but the entrance to a secret cavern, before which a great stone has been rolled so that none may enter. Perhaps it is the hiding place where Ali Baba and his band of thieves have stored their treasures, in which case that magic word known to every school child who ever delighted over the tales of the Arabian Nights should be enough to push the stone aside. But take care - the cliff is steep, and one slip will send you tumbling down into the ravine below. This is the one and only time that the second stroke in cliff will reach over to the middle of the horizontal stroke. If you think of the edge jutting outwards (in keeping with the story above), the problem should be taken care of. 	  * The stone is a quite common primitive element, which is not restricted to great boulders but used of stones or rocks of any size or shape. 	 	Indiana Jones jumps up and grabs the lip of cliff just in time to evade the huge STONE rolling out of the mouth of the cave!

A ""chip off the old block"" is the way we often put it, but the character is more simple. It speaks of a little bit of flesh. 	  * When used as a primitive, the sense of resemblance is replaced by that of spark or candle. (If you want an explanation: the kanji for moon also carries a secondary sense of fire, which we omitted because we are keeping that meaning for other primitives.) 	 	Using DNA matching, a very little bit of flesh can be used to show the resemblence between family members. 	 	On-Yomi: ショウ   Kun-Yomi: あやか.る"
nitrate	"nitrate 	 	硝   	   	Lesson: 7   Frame: 120   Strokes: 12   —   Jouyou Grade: JH   JLPT: 1   	Constituents: nitrate, stone, rock, resemblance, spark, candle, small, little, moon, month, flesh, part of the body 	 	The word nitrate should immediately suggest a beaker of nitric acid, which, as every high-school chemistry student knows, can eat its way through some pretty tough substances. Here we imagine pouring it over a rock and watching the sparks fly as it bores a hole through the rock. 	 	 	That stone has sparks coming out of it! Someone must have poured nitrate acid on it.

smash	"smash 	 	砕   	   	Lesson: 7   Frame: 121   Strokes: 9   —   Jouyou Grade: JH   JLPT: 1   	Constituents: smash, stone, rock, ninety, nine, baseball, ten, needle 	 	We begin with the two elements on the right, baseball and needle. Since they will be coming together from time to time, let us give the two of them the sense of a game of cricket in which a needle is laid across the wicket. Then imagine using a rock for a ball. A smash hit would probably splinter the bat in all directions, and a smashing pitch would do the same with the needle wicket. 	 	 	To SMASH a STONE you need to hit it NINE or TEN times. 	 	On-Yomi: サイ   Kun-Yomi: くだ.く、くだ.ける  	Examples: 砕く (くだ.く), 砕ける (くだ.ける)"

That means that all of us whose feet have been spoiled by too much time in shoes don't have to watch our step as we cavort about. 	 	 	Here´s how I remember that stone is on the left. This is because sand starts as stones, and only later they become few. 	 	On-Yomi: サ、シャ   Kun-Yomi: すな  	Examples: 砂丘 (さきゅう), 砂糖 (さとう), 砂 (すな)"
plane	"plane 	 	削   	   	Lesson: 7   Frame: 124   Strokes: 9   —   Jouyou Grade: JH   JLPT: 1   	Constituents: plane, resemblance, spark, candle, small, little, moon, month, flesh, part of the body, sword, sabre, saber 	 	Long before the invention of the carpenter's plane, people used knives and machetes (or here, sabers) to smooth out their woodwork. If you have ever seen the process, you will have been amazed at the speed and agility with which the adept can plane a hunk of wood into shape. Indeed, you can almost see the sparks fly from their sabers. 	 	 	Sparks will fly if you attempt to PLANE your sabre. 	 	On-Yomi: サク   Kun-Yomi: けず.る、はつ.る、そ.ぐ  	Examples: 削る (けず.る)"

The 4th stroke that separates them is added for reasons of aesthetics. (If that doesn't make sense, try writing the kanji without it and see how ugly the results look, even to your beginner's eye.) Now if you have wondered what those little particles of ""dust"" are that dance around in the light-rays that come through the window and fall on your desk, try imagining them as little and disembodied human legs, and you should have no trouble with this character. 	 	 	A ray of light is not a wave but made of little photons with human legs. 	 	On-Yomi: コウ   Kun-Yomi: ひか.る、ひかり  	Examples: 光る (ひか.る), 光 (ひかり)"

No sooner do you hear it than you think of a round and ample-bodied person falling into a sofa like a large drop of oil plopping into a fishbowl - kerrrr-plump! 	 	 	A large person with a big drop of sweat dripping off of him because he is so plump. 	 	On-Yomi: タイ、タ   Kun-Yomi: ふと.い、ふと.る  	Examples: 太陽 (たいよう), 太鼓 (たいこ), 皇太子 (こうたいし), 太い (ふと.い), 太る (ふと.る)"

It shows a large and fluffy St. Bernard dog stretched out on a table all stuffed and stewed and garnished with vegetables, its paws in the air and an apple in its mouth. At each corner of the table sits an eager but empty mouth, waiting for the utensils to arrive so the feast can begin. 	 	 	Imagine four hungry mouths all sitting around the table. They are all banging their utensils on the table waiting for a big meal to be placed in the centre. 	 	On-Yomi: キ   Kun-Yomi: うつわ  	Examples: 器 (うつわ)"
stinking	"stinking 	 	臭   	   	Lesson: 7   Frame: 128   Strokes: 9   —   Jouyou Grade: JH   JLPT: 1   	Constituents: stinking, nose, drop, eye, large, St. Bernard 	 	This character is a bit friendlier to the animal world. Our friend the St. Bernard is alive and well, its nose in the air sniffing suspiciously after something stinking somewhere or other. 	 	 	The ST. BERNARD DOG lifted his large NOSE high in the air to find out where the stinking smell comes from. 	 	On-Yomi: シュウ   Kun-Yomi: くさ.い、-くさ.い、にお.う、にお.い  	Examples: 臭い (くさ.い)"
exquisite	"exquisite 	 	妙   	   	Lesson: 7   Frame: 130   Strokes: 7   —   Jouyou Grade: JH   JLPT: 1   	Constituents: exquisite, woman, few 	 	The primitive for woman is on the left (there and at the bottom of another primitive is where you will always find her), and to the right the element for few. When we refer to a woman as exquisite, we mean to praise her as the sort of person we meet but few and far between. If you are interested in etymologies, it might help to recall that the Latin phrase lying at the root of the English word exquisite carries this same sense of ""seeking out"" the rare from the ordinary. 	 	 	Exquisite women are few and far between. 	 	On-Yomi: ミョウ、ビョウ   Kun-Yomi: たえ"
focus	"focus 	 	省   	   	Lesson: 7   Frame: 131   Strokes: 9   —   Jouyou Grade: 4   JLPT: 2   	Constituents: focus, few, eye 	 	When we think of focusing on something, we usually take it in a metaphorical sense, though the literal sense is not far behind. It means to block out what is nonessential in order to fix our eye on a few important matters. The kanji suggests picking up a few things and holding them before one's eye in order to focus on them better. 	 	 	You focus by concentrating your eye on fewer objects. 	 	On-Yomi: セイ、ショウ   Kun-Yomi: かえり.みる、はぶ.く  	Examples: 反省 (はんせい), 内省 (ないせい), 帰省 (きせい), 省みる (かえり.みる), 省く (はぶ.く)"
thick	"thick 	 	厚   	   	Lesson: 7   Frame: 132   Strokes: 9   —   Jouyou Grade: 5   JLPT: 2   	Constituents: thick, cliff, sun, day, child 	 	When we refer to someone as thick-skinned or thick-headed, we are usually quick to add - even if only under our breath - something about their upbringing. Perhaps it is because deep down we cherish the belief that by nature people are basically tender and sensitive. Be that as it may, the Japanese character for thick depicts a child abandoned out on the wild cliffs, exposed to the heat of the sun, and thus doomed to develop a head and skin as thick as the parent who left it there. 	 	 	In Sparta we throw our Children over a Cliff. Under the Sun, they fight other Children. In the end, if they survive, they sure have thick skin. 	 	On-Yomi: コウ   Kun-Yomi: あつ.い、あか  	Examples: 厚い (あつ.い)"
strange	"strange 	 	奇   	   	Lesson: 7   Frame: 133   Strokes: 8   —   Jouyou Grade: JH   JLPT: 1   	Constituents: strange, large, St. Bernard, can, mouth, street, nail, spike 	 	The elements we are given to work with here are St. Bernard dog and can. Lots of phrases pop to mind to attach these words to the key word, but they end up too abstract because of the word can. It is important in such cases (and there will be plenty of them as we go along) to stick closely to the elements, in this case, mouth and nails. Now all we need do is create a fictitious ""Strange But True"" column in the Sunday funnies, featuring a St. Bernard whose mouth has been nailed shut because he was hitting the brandy keg around his neck too hard. 	 	 	I find it strange that so many people commit suicide in Tokyo by throwing themselves in front of the train. To me when I look at this kanji, I see a train just about to come out of a tunnel, and above the man waiting for his oppourtunity where he can end it all.

stream	"stream 	 	川   	   	Lesson: 8   Frame: 134   Strokes: 3   —   Jouyou Grade: 1   JLPT: 5   	Constituents: stream, flood 	 	We have taken the image of a river stream over into English to describe things that fall down in straight lines, or ripple along in lines. All of this is more than evident in the kanji given here, a pictograph of a stream. 	  * As a primitive, this character adds to the meaning of stream the more vivid image of a flood. Note, however, that there are certain small changes in the writing of the element, depending on where it appears relative to other elements: on the left, it is written the same. on the top, it is written with the three strokes more like less-then signs on the bottom, it is written with the third stroke similar to a fishhook 	 	So as not to confuse this with river (#146) think of streamers falling down. 	 	On-Yomi: セン   Kun-Yomi: かわ  	Examples: 川 (かわ)"
state	"state 	 	州   	   	Lesson: 8   Frame: 135   Strokes: 6   —   Jouyou Grade: 3   JLPT: 2   	Constituents: state, stream, flood, drops 	 	Here we see drops of land (little islets) rising up out of a stream, creating a kind of sandbar or breakwater. Ever wonder how the state-line is drawn between states separated by a river? If there were little drops of land as in the kanji, there'd be nothing to it. 	 	 	There were 3 little islands in the stream who all decided to set themselves up as independent states. 	 	On-Yomi: シュウ、ス   Kun-Yomi: す  	Examples: 州 (す)"
obey	"obey 	 	順   	   	Lesson: 8   Frame: 136   Strokes: 12   —   Jouyou Grade: 4   JLPT: 2   	Constituents: obey, stream, flood, head, page, one, ceiling, drop, shellfish, clam, oyster, eye, animal legs, eight 	 	In primitive language, this character would read stream . . . head. And that turns out to be convenient for remembering its meaning of obey. Either one obeys the person who is head of an organization or else obeys by following the stream of opinion (""current"" practice, we call it). Both these senses come together in this kanji. 	 	 	Obey, Obey! says the brain-washing scientist as he sends a stream of orders to fill your head. 	 	On-Yomi: ジュン   Kun-Yomi:"
water	"water 	 	水   	   	Lesson: 8   Frame: 137   Strokes: 4   —   Jouyou Grade: 1   JLPT: 5   	Constituents: water 	 	This character, which looks a bit like a snowflake, is actually a pictograph of water - not any particular body of water or movement of water, but simply the generic name for water. Should you have any difficulty remembering it, simply think of a walking stick being dropped vertically into the water, sending droplets out in all four directions. Then all you need to learn is how to write it in proper order. 	  * As a primitive, this character can keep its form, or it can be written with three drops to the left of another primitive. This latter, as we will see, is far more common. 	 	The kanji for water is an abstract primitive itself, so unless one is willing to break down its etymological development, it should just simply be memorized by strokes; constructing a story is not necessarily useful unless it strongly denotes its shape (I find that Heisig´s story doesn´t do this). 	 	On-Yomi: スイ   Kun-Yomi: みず、みず-  	Examples: 水 (みず)"
icicle	"icicle 	 	氷   	   	Lesson: 8   Frame: 138   Strokes: 5   —   Jouyou Grade: 3   JLPT: 2   	Constituents: icicle, drop, water 	 	The appearance of the primitive for water in its full form tells us that we have something to do with water here. The extra drop to the left, added as a second stroke, changes the picture from a splash caused by a walking stick dropped into water to form an icicle. If it helps, when you hold an icicle up to the light, you can usually see little crystallizations of five-pointed stars inside of it, which is the shape we have in this kanji. 	 	 	Icicles start with 1 frozen drop of water. 	 	On-Yomi: ヒョウ   Kun-Yomi: こおり、ひ、こお.る  	Examples: 氷 (こおり), 氷 (ひ)"
eternity	"eternity 	 	永   	   	Lesson: 8   Frame: 139   Strokes: 5   —   Jouyou Grade: 5   JLPT: 2   	Constituents: eternity, drop, water 	 	This kanji also uses the full form of water, though its meaning seems to have nothing at all to do with water. Remember what William Blake said about seeing ""infinity in a grain of sand and eternity in an hour""? Well, reading this character from top to bottom, we see ""eternity in a drop of water."" 	 	 	It would take an eternity to count all the drops of water. 	 	On-Yomi: エイ   Kun-Yomi: なが.い  	Examples: 永い (なが.い)"
spring	"spring 	 	泉   	   	Lesson: 8   Frame: 140   Strokes: 9   —   Jouyou Grade: 6   JLPT: 2   	Constituents: spring, white, dove, water 	 	Call to mind the image of a fresh, bubbling spring of water, and you will probably notice how the top of the spring you are thinking of, the part where the ""bubbling"" goes on, is all white. Happily, the white is just where it should be, at the top, and the water is at the bottom. 	  * We will keep this image of a spring when using this kanji as a primitive, but not without first drawing attention to a slight change that distinguishes the primitive from the kanji. The final 4 strokes (the element for water) are abbreviated to the three small drops that we learned earlier as the kanji for little. 	 	White is a symbol of purety, so white water is pure water, the precise definition of spring water. 	 	On-Yomi: セン   Kun-Yomi: いずみ  	Examples: 泉 (いずみ)"
meadow	"meadow 	 	原   	   	Lesson: 8   Frame: 142   Strokes: 10   —   Jouyou Grade: 2   JLPT: 3   	Constituents: meadow, cliff, spring, white, dove, small, little 	 	Though the kanji is broad enough to embrace both meanings, the meadow you should imagine here is not a flatland plain but a mountain meadow in the Austrian Alps. (Perhaps the opening scene of ""The Sound of Music"" will help.) Simply think of little springs bubbling up across the meadow to form a sort of path that leads you right to the brink of a precipitous cliff. Now if you can see Schwester Maria skipping along merrily, dodging in and out of the springs, and then falling headlong over the cliff, you have a ridiculous story that should help fix this kanji in memory. 	 	 	Follow the springs down the cliff and you will find a nice meadow. 	 	On-Yomi: ゲン   Kun-Yomi: はら  	Examples: 原 (はら)"
petition	"petition 	 	願   	   	Lesson: 8   Frame: 143   Strokes: 19   —   Jouyou Grade: 4   JLPT: 3   	Constituents: petition, meadow, cliff, white, dove, small, little, head, page, one, ceiling, drop, shellfish, clam, oyster, eye, animal legs, eight 	 	A meadow and a head are all we are given to work with in the kanji for petition. Since the key word already suggests something like a formal request made of some higher power, let us imagine a gigantic Wizard-of-Oz head located in the middle of the flowery meadow we used in the last frame. Then just picture people kneeling hopefully before it, petitioning for whatever it is they want. (The scarecrow wanted brains, the lion, courage, and the tin man a heart. What about you?) 	 	 	Let´s petition to save that beautiful MEADOW from overdevelopment by signing on this PAGE. 	 	On-Yomi: ガン   Kun-Yomi: ねが.う、-ねがい  	Examples: 願う (ねが.う)"

To the right, we see the kanji for eternity. Knowing how much children like swimming, what could be a better image of eternal bliss than an endless expanse of water to swim in without a care in the world? 	 	 	With that much WATER (2 actually) you would need to swim for an ETERNITY. 	 	On-Yomi: エイ   Kun-Yomi: およ.ぐ  	Examples: 泳ぐ (およ.ぐ)"
marsh	"marsh 	 	沼   	   	Lesson: 8   Frame: 145   Strokes: 8   —   Jouyou Grade: JH   JLPT: 1   	Constituents: marsh, water, water droplets, water pistol, summon, seduce, sword, dagger, mouth 	 	Unlike the meadow with its cliffs, the marshlands are low and near a source of water that feeds them until they get soggy through and through. Why certain land becomes marshy is probably due to the fact that it felt thirsty, and so tried its best to seduce the water over to its side. But, like most inordinate seductions, the last state of the victim is worse than the first. Hence the slushy marsh. 	 	 	The marshlands near Mordor seduce Frodo into gazing upon them, and he falls into the water--splash! 	 	On-Yomi: ショウ   Kun-Yomi: ぬま  	Examples: 沼 (ぬま)"
open sea	"open sea 	 	沖   	   	Lesson: 8   Frame: 146   Strokes: 7   —   Jouyou Grade: JH   JLPT: 1   	Constituents: open sea, water, water droplets, water pistol, in, stick, mouth 	 	This kanji could hardly be simpler. The key word open sea readily suggests being out in the middle of a great body of water .Thinking of it in this way should avoid confusion with the kanji for ""open,"" which we will meet later on. 	 	 	Open sea is a lot of water in the middle of nowhere. 	 	On-Yomi: チュウ   Kun-Yomi: おき、おきつ、ちゅう.する、わく  	Examples: 沖 (おき)"
creek	"creek 	 	江   	   	Lesson: 8   Frame: 148   Strokes: 6   —   Jouyou Grade: JH   JLPT: 1   	Constituents: creek, water, water droplets, water pistol, craft 	 	Unlike the river, the ocean, the lake, and the pond, the creek is often no more then a dribble of water trickling down a small gully. While the geological history of the larger bodies of water is hard to surmise sometimes, all of us know from our childhood how creeks are made. You probably even dug one or two in your time. All you need to do is find a mainstream of water somewhere and dig a little path into dry land. The creek is thus a lesson in water-craft, as this kanji would agree. 	 	 	A CREEK is a small trail of water easily crafted with a stick. 	 	On-Yomi: コウ   Kun-Yomi: え  	Examples: 江 (え)"
soup	"soup 	 	汁   	   	Lesson: 8   Frame: 150   Strokes: 5   —   Jouyou Grade: JH   JLPT: 1   	Constituents: soup, water, water droplets, water pistol, ten, needle 	 	To make soup, one begins with water and then starts adding things to it, often leftovers from the icebox. This is how the thick soup or stew called ""seven-in-one"" is made. This kanji does it three better, giving us a ten-ingredient soup. 	 	 	To make soup you just take water and add (+) the rest of your ingredients. 	 	On-Yomi: ジュウ   Kun-Yomi: しる、-しる、つゆ  	Examples: 汁 (しる)"
tide	"tide 	 	潮   	   	Lesson: 8   Frame: 152   Strokes: 15   —   Jouyou Grade: 6   JLPT: 1   	Constituents: tide, water, water droplets, water pistol, morning , mist, ten, needle, early, sun, day, moon, month, flesh, part of the body, ten2, needle2 	 	Before we get to explaining this character, take a look at it and see if you can figure out the primitive elements on your own.... On the left is the water - that much is easy. On the right we have only one primitive, the kanji for morning learned back in Frame 53. See how an apparently complex kanji falls apart neatly into manageable pieces? To get the meaning of the key word tide, just think of it in connection with the character for eventide that we learned back in Frame 115. Here we have the morning-tide, its complement. By the way, if you missed the question about the number of primitives, it is probably because you forgot what we said earlier about kanji becoming primitives, independently of the pieces that make them up. As a rule, look for the largest kanji you can write and proceed from there to primitives stranded on their own. 	 	 	The morning tide is basically, well, WATER in the MORNING.

Both in its etymology (it has a common parent with the word ""surge"") and in popular usage, source suggests the place water comes from. In this kanji, it is under the meadow, where we just saw it breaking the surface in those bubbly little springs. 	 	 	The water that flows from the meadow is the source of life for the wild antelope. 	 	On-Yomi: ゲン   Kun-Yomi: みなもと  	Examples: 源 (みなもと)"

This kanji depicts the idea of lively by having tongues babble and splash around like flowing water. 	 	 	Conversations can become more lively after everyone has had a few drinks. It´s because ""watery tongues"" loosen lips! 	 	On-Yomi: カツ   Kun-Yomi: い.きる、い.かす、い.ける"
extinguish	"extinguish 	 	消   	   	Lesson: 8   Frame: 155   Strokes: 10   —   Jouyou Grade: 3   JLPT: 3   	Constituents: extinguish, water, water droplets, water pistol, resemblance, spark, candle, small, little, moon, month, flesh, part of the body 	 	Among the many things water is useful for is extinguishing fires, and that is just what we have here. First of all, take the water at the left as the drops of water that are used to depict water in general. In the best of all possible worlds, the most efficient way to extinguish a fire would be to see that each drop of water hits one spark of the conflagration. An unthinkable bit of utopian fire fighting, you say to yourself, but helpful for assigning this key word its primitives. 	 	 	To extinguish a SPARK, you need WATER. 	 	On-Yomi: ショウ   Kun-Yomi: き.える、け.す  	Examples: 消える (き.える), 消す (け.す)"
but of course	"but of course 	 	況   	   	Lesson: 8   Frame: 156   Strokes: 8   —   Jouyou Grade: JH   JLPT: 2   	Constituents: but of course, water, water droplets, water pistol, elder brother, teenager, mouth, human legs 	 	This key word is a connector used to link contrasting phrase sand sentences together with much the same flavor as the English phrase but of course. Just picture yourself ready to go off on your first date as a teenager, and having your mother grill you about your manners and ask you embarrassing questions about your hygiene. ""Did you have a good shower?"" ""But of course,"" you reply, annoyed. So water and teenager combine to give us but of course. 	 	 	If you ask your teenager if what he´s drinking is water (and not Vodka), he will answer ""but of course"". 	 	On-Yomi: キョウ   Kun-Yomi: まし.て、いわ.んや、おもむき"

The water to the left tells us what we are dealing with, and the can at the right tells us that our ""little engine that could"" has now become amphibious and is chugging down the Mighty Mississip' like a regular riverboat. 	 	 	A river CAN exist only if there is WATER. 	 	On-Yomi: カ   Kun-Yomi: かわ  	Examples: 河 (かわ)"

You have heard of legends of people being abandoned in the mountains when they had become too old to work. Well, here is a legend about people being set adrift in the waters of a stormy lake because their flesh had gotten too old to bear the burdens of life. 	 	 	This is my favorite story. Simply associate the sad moment of an OLD person, standing near the WATER of the lake and looking at the MOON reflected in the lake. The created primitives themselves are put so beautifully, that you will not forget this kanji. 	 	On-Yomi: コ   Kun-Yomi: みずうみ  	Examples: 湖 (みずうみ)"
fathom	"fathom 	 	測   	   	Lesson: 8   Frame: 160   Strokes: 12   —   Jouyou Grade: 5   JLPT: 2   	Constituents: fathom, water, water droplets, water pistol, rule, shellfish, clam, oyster, eye, animal legs, eight, sword, sabre, saber 	 	Connoting the measurement of the depth of water, the keyword fathom begins with the water primitive. To its right, we see the compound-primitive for rule (Frame 92) which we learned in the sense of a ""ruler"" or ""measure."" Hence, when we rule water we fathom it. What could be simpler? But be careful; its simplicity is deceptive. Be sure to picture yourself fathoming a body of water several hundred feet deep by using a ruler of gargantuan proportions. 	 	 	A fathom is the unit you use when making rules about water´s depth. 	 	On-Yomi: ソク   Kun-Yomi: はか.る  	Examples: 測る (はか.る)"
soil	"soil 	 	土   	   	Lesson: 8   Frame: 161   Strokes: 3   —   Jouyou Grade: 1   JLPT: 5   	Constituents: soil, dirt, ground 	 	I don't like it any more than you do, but this kanji is not the pictograph it is trumped up to be: a mound of soil piled on the ground. All I can recommend is that you memorize it as it is. Anyway, it will be occurring with such frequency that you have almost no chance of forgetting it, even if you try. 	  * As a primitive, the sense of soil is extended to that of ground because of its connection with the kanji for the same (Frame 554). From there it also takes the added meanings of dirt and land. 	 	Remembering soil is easy. If soil is soft, you can take a walking stick and plunge it two* feet into the ground. 	 	On-Yomi: ド、ト   Kun-Yomi: つち  	Examples: 土木 (どぼく), 国土 (こくど), 粘土 (ねんど), 土 (つち)"

It is not hard to imagine what you might do if you got a mouth full of dirt. As least I know what I would do: spit it out as fast and far as I could! 	 	 	The only things that come out of my MOUTH and onto the GROUND are spit and vomit. Everything else (words, song) floats on the air. 	 	On-Yomi: ト   Kun-Yomi: は.く、つ.く  	Examples: 吐く (は.く)"

This can be caused by any number of things from heavy rainfall to heavy buildings to the absence of sufficient deep-rooted vegetation to hold the layers together. Here we see a steep cliff without a tree in sight. The slightest pressure on it will cause a landslide, which, with a little help from your imagination, you will be able to see happening in this character. 	 	 	The GROUND at the base of a CLIFF must suffer from enormous pressure. 	 	On-Yomi: アツ、エン、オウ   Kun-Yomi: お.す、へ.す、おさ.える、お.さえる"

The soil on the left tells us we have to do with land, and the strange on the right tells us it is a cape where unusual things go on. Put a haunted house on it, an eerie sky overhead, and a howling wind rustling through the trees, and you have yourself a picture of Cape Strange (or, if you prefer, Cape Odd). 	 	 	This refers to LAND, not the STRANGE gear superheroes wear. 	 	On-Yomi: キ   Kun-Yomi: さき、さい、みさき  	Examples: 埼 (さい)"

Before the Great Wall of China, there was a dirt hedge that spanned across. 	 	On-Yomi: エン   Kun-Yomi: かき  	Examples: 垣 (かき)"

The character in this frame is going to get one meaning and the primitive another, with no relation at all between the two. In time, I hope you will see how helpful this is. The kanji key word, square jewel, depicts a mammoth precious stone, several feet high, made by piling up large heaps of soil on top of one another. Not something you would want to present your betrothed on your wedding day, but a good image for remembering this rare character, used chiefly in personal names nowadays. 	  * As a primitive, we shall use this character to mean ivy, that creepy vegetation that covers the surface of the ground to form a sort of ""second"" ground that can get somewhat tricky to walk on without tripping. 	 	Piling SOIL upon SOIL for aeons is how SQUARE JEWELS are formed deep in the earth. 	 	On-Yomi: ケイ、ケ   Kun-Yomi:"
seal	"seal 	 	封   	   	Lesson: 8   Frame: 168   Strokes: 9   —   Jouyou Grade: JH   JLPT: 2   	Constituents: seal, ivy, square jewel, soil, dirt, ground, glue, soil2, dirt2, ground2 	 	Think of the key word seal as referring to a letter you have written and are preparing to close. Instead of using the traditional wax seal, you glue a sprig of ivy on the outside. In this way the elements ivy and glue give you a curious and memorable way to seal your secret letters. 	 	 	The king used a special seal of ivy leaves glued onto his document. 	 	On-Yomi: フウ、ホウ   Kun-Yomi:   	Examples: 封鎖 (ふうさ), 封書 (ふうしょ), 密封 (みっぷう)"

Of course, you'd need the eyes of a stellar telescope to recognize that the vegetation was in fact ivy, but the phrase ""ivy-clad cliffs"" has such a nice ring to it that we won't worry about such details. 	 	 	Try to reverse Heisig´s story in this Kanji: imagine being trapped in one of those prison towers on an ivy cladcliff like in the movies. From your prison ontop the ivy clad cliff all you can see in the distant horizon is nothing but water. 	 	On-Yomi: ガイ   Kun-Yomi: はて"

Here is your chance to take that metaphor literally and imagine some fellow walking into a Buddhist temple with a fervent resolve to attach himself to the place. Since there is plenty of unused land around the precincts, he simply picks out a suitable patch, brushes the soles of his feet with glue, steps down firmly, and so joins the Buddhist temple as a ""permanent member."" 	 	 	At the Buddhist temple the monks are seated on the ground, glued there in meditation. 	 	On-Yomi: ジ   Kun-Yomi: てら  	Examples: 寺 (てら)"

""Ask me not, and I know. Ask me, and I cannot tell you."" Here we have the kanji's answer to that perennial riddle. Time is a sun rising over a Buddhist temple. It sounds almost like a Zen kōan whose repetition might yield some deep secret to the initiated. At any rate, imagining a monk seated in meditation pondering it might help us remember the character. 	 	 	When the SUN starts to shine on the TEMPLE, it´s time to get up.

It pictures soil being scooped up into a ladle and then made level (apparently because one is measuring soil). The excess drops of soil are brushed off the top, which accounts for the added drop at the ladle's edge. 	 	 	Soil is scooped up into a ladel. The extra drop is brushed off to make it level.

fire	"fire 	 	火   	   	Lesson: 8   Frame: 173   Strokes: 4   —   Jouyou Grade: 1   JLPT: 5   	Constituents: fire 	 	Just as sitting before a fire enlivens the imagination and lets you see almost anything you want to in the flames, this kanji is so simple it lets you see almost any sort of fire you want to see. It no longer makes a good pictograph, but I invite you to take a pencil and paper and play with the form - first writing it as shown below and then adding lines here and there - to see what you can come up with. Everything from matchbooks to cigarette lighters to volcanic eruptions to the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah have been found here. No doubt you, too, will find something interesting to bend your memory around these four simple strokes. 	  * To avoid confusion later on, it is best to keep to the meaning of a fireplace (or hearth) or a raging conflagration like a forest fire for this kanji's primitive meaning. Another primitive element for fire, based on this one, is written as 4 small drops and will mean flames, cauldron, cooking fire, or an oven fire. 	 	For some reason, this kanji reminds me of a person running, her arms (the two drops) raised up, because she caught on fire! 	 	On-Yomi: カ   Kun-Yomi: ひ、-び、ほ-  	Examples: 火 (ひ)"
inflammation	"inflammation 	 	炎   	   	Lesson: 8   Frame: 174   Strokes: 8   —   Jouyou Grade: JH   JLPT: 1   	Constituents: inflammation, fire, fire2 	 	A fire belongs IN the hearth, not OVER it. When the fire spreads to the rest of the house, we have an inflamed house. And as with any inflammation - including those that attack our bodies - the danger is always that it might spread if not checked. This is the sense behind the reduplication of element for fire, one atop the other. 	 	 	To fight fire with fire would just inflame a situation. 	 	On-Yomi: エン   Kun-Yomi: ほのお  	Examples: 炎 (ほのお)"
anxiety	"anxiety 	 	煩   	   	Lesson: 8   Frame: 175   Strokes: 13   —   Jouyou Grade: JH   JLPT: 1   	Constituents: anxiety, fire, head, page, one, ceiling, drop, shellfish, clam, oyster, eye, animal legs, eight 	 	The existential condition of anxiety that arises from the inevitable frustration of our worldly passions is contained in this character. The head is set afire, causing deep torment of spirit (and a whopper of a headache). 	 	 	An anxiety feels like FIRE in the HEAD. 	 	On-Yomi: ハン、ボン   Kun-Yomi: わずら.う、わずら.わす  	Examples: 煩雑 (はんざつ), 煩う (わずら.う), 煩わす (わずら.わす)"
thin	"thin 	 	淡   	   	Lesson: 8   Frame: 176   Strokes: 11   —   Jouyou Grade: JH   JLPT: 1   	Constituents: thin, water, water droplets, water pistol, inflammation, fire, fire2 	 	The primitives in this kanji read: water . . . inflammation. Taking inflammation in its medical sense, the first water-related inflammation that pops into mind is dehydration, the principal symptom of which is that it makes one shrivel up and look very, very thin. If that is hard to remember, try thinking it backwards: a very thin chap passes by and you imagine him suffering from (being inflamed with) dehydration (hence the element for water). 	 	 	Drink water and burn twice as many calories as you eat... you´ll definitely get thin. Imagine inside your body, all those calories literally being burned from above and below... THAT´s what it takes to become thin. 	 	On-Yomi: タン   Kun-Yomi: あわ.い  	Examples: 淡い (あわ.い)"

Voilà! The lamp. 	 	 	Imagine old gas lamps which had a flame to light up the street signs. 	 	On-Yomi: トウ   Kun-Yomi: ひ、ほ-、ともしび、とも.す、あかり  	Examples: 灯 (ひ)"

Many farms are created by first setting FIRE over the land to clear the land for the FIELDS. 	 	On-Yomi:    Kun-Yomi: はた、はたけ、-ばたけ  	Examples: 畑 (はた), 畑 (はたけ)"

To recall the disposition of the elements, think of nature's solution to nature's own problem: a great flood pouring down over a great forest fire. 	 	 	What a disaster! First a FIRE, then on top of it came FLOODs. 	 	On-Yomi: サイ   Kun-Yomi: わざわ.い  	Examples: 災い (わざわ.い)"

Now what do you do with that bucket of ashes you have just cleaned out of the fireplace? You walk to the edge of a cliff and tip it upside down, watching as they are swept away in the wind like a swarm of gray mosquitoes. Thus the fire, once it has turned to ashes, ends up at the bottom of the cliff. 	 	 	The fire underneath the cliff will eventually turn everything above to ashes.

Although nobody ever thought of such a thing before - as least as far as know, they didn't - imagine using those spots as a technique for fortune-telling. The old witch sits before her cauldron and watches the spots that show up when she turns to look at you, and from that tells your fortune. Think of it as a kind of spot-check on your future. 	 	 	The FORTUNE TELLER was burned by FLAMES on the spot because she was accused of being a witch. 	 	On-Yomi: テン   Kun-Yomi: つ.ける、つ.く、た.てる、さ.す、とぼ.す、とも.す、ぼち"

If you glaze a pot and put it into the oven to fire it, you in fact illuminate it. Hence the kanji for illuminate compares the kanji for shining with the primitive element for the oven's fire. 	 	 	SHINING FLAMES illuminate! 	 	On-Yomi: ショウ   Kun-Yomi: て.る、て.らす、て.れる  	Examples: 照らす (て.らす), 照る (て.る), 照れる (て.れる)"

Not much to work with at first sight. But we can join them together by thinking of a three-part story: first a fish is caught and bound up on a line with its unfortunate school-mates; when the fisherman gets home, he cuts off the head and tosses it, with the entrails, out into the rice fields for fertilizer; and the rest he sets in a skillet over a cooking fire for his supper. 	 	 	The elements of this kanji are bound up, rice field and cooking fire. When I think of bound up cooked rice, it makes me think of sushi, which in turn brings to mind fish.

Be sure to get a clear image of the water when you put it all together. 	 	 	You need WATER and FISH for fishing. 	 	On-Yomi: ギョ、リョウ   Kun-Yomi: あさ.る  	Examples: 漁業 (ぎょぎょう), 漁船 (ぎょせん), 漁村 (ぎょそん)"

Don't bother looking it up in your English dictionary; it's a Japanese word for measuring distances. One ri is about 4 kilometers or 2.5 miles. The kanji depicts how the measure came to be used. Atop we see the rice field, and below the element for land. Those four sections you see in the rice field (and which we made mention of when first we introduced the character in frame 14) are actually measurements of land, much the same as farm-sections in the United States have given us the notion of a ""country mile."" The land division based on the size of a rice field is called a ri. 	  * To get a more concrete primitive meaning for this kanji, we shall refer to it as a computer, a meaning deriving from the kanji for logic, which we will meet in Lesson 12. 	 	The ri is a Japanese way of measuring the area of the GROUND underneath a RICE FIELD. 	 	On-Yomi: リ   Kun-Yomi: さと  	Examples: 里 (さと)"

It is not the last time it will happen in this book, but I can assure you they are used only when absolutely necessary. One rin is equal to about 1/1000 of a yen - or rather was worth that much when it still made economic sense to mint them. While inflation took its toll on this kanji as a monetary unit, it survived with the not at all surprising sense of something ""very, very tiny."" The kanji shows a cliff with a computer under it, apparently because it has been pushed over into the abyss by someone fed up with the thing. The total market value of one home computer that has fallen over rock and bramble for several hundred feet: about one rin! 	 	 	I threw my Rindows computer off a cliff because it kept crashing. Now, after its last crash, it´s worth less than a rin. 	 	On-Yomi: リン   Kun-Yomi:"

Only here, we are burying our beloved computer that has served us so well these past years. Behind us a choir chants the ""Dies irae, dies illa"" and there is much wailing and grief among the bystanders as they pass by to shovel a little dirt into what will be its final resting place. R.I.P. 	 	 	You can´t bury computers underground, because of the dangerous heavy metals, so you hide them behind an equally large mound of soil and hope no-one notices.

Let us take the key word to connote the sameness that characterizes the life in community of the monk. They all have the same habits, including the ""habit"" they wear on their backs. Here we see the monk's cowl, drawn down over the eyes so that all you can see when you look at him is a mouth. But since monks also speak their prayers in common, it is but a short step to think of one mouth under a hood as the kanji for the sameness of monastic life. 	  * As a primitive, this will mean monks dressed in a common habit. 	 	Muslim women wearing veils (HOOD) all look the same, you can just see ONE MOUTH and very little else. 	 	On-Yomi: ドウ   Kun-Yomi: おな.じ  	Examples: 同じ (おな.じ)"

Now if we keep to the image of the monastic life as an image for same, we can picture a den of wild beasts dressed up in habits and living the common life in a mountain cavern. To bring in the element of water we need only give them a sacred ""puddle"" in the center of their den, the focus of all their pious attentions. 	 	 	All the animals in the den share the same water. 	 	On-Yomi: ドウ   Kun-Yomi: ほら  	Examples: 洞 (ほら)"

I can hardly think of any reason for doing so, unless one were lumberjacking corpses and needed to have them all properly pruned and made the same so they could be floated downstream without causing a body-jam.

Hence this kanji begins with a drop. Then we find a sort of transparent helmet with no eyes or nose, but only a prominent mouth under it, obviously an extraterrestrial. And what is it jabbering on about with its mouth open like that? Why, about his spaceship way over yonder with its fuel tank on empty. 	 	 	Look over yonder ! That tiny dot is robin hood at the mouth of his secret cave ! 	 	On-Yomi: コウ   Kun-Yomi: む.く、む.い、-む.き、む.ける、-む.け、む.かう、む.かい、む.こう、む.こう-、むこ、むか.い  	Examples: 向かう (む.かう), 向く (む.く), 向ける (む.ける), 向こう (む.こう)"

The littleness is important, because what is in fact on display is the shrunken, stuffed, and mounted mouth of an esteemed ancestor. We may be used to esteeming the words our forebears leave behind, but here we also esteem the very mouth that spoke them. I leave it to you to imagine a suitable place in your room for displaying such an unusual conversation piece. 	 	 	An especially esteemed alien has three antennae on his helmet.

Not just kanji, but any written character from hieroglyphs to Sanskrit to our own Roman alphabet. It shows us simply a child in a house. But let us take advantage of the double-meaning of the key word to note that just as a child born to a Japanese house is given characters for its name, so it is also stamped with the character of those who raise it from infancy on. 	 	 	CHILDren learn Kanji characters underneath a HOUSE. 	 	On-Yomi: ジ   Kun-Yomi: あざ、あざな、-な  	Examples: 字 (あざ)"

The whole idea of hiring guards is that they should stick like glue to your house to protect it from unwanted prowlers. So go ahead and glue a guard to your house in imagination. 	 	 	A GUARD is usually ""glued"" to the house he watches. 	 	On-Yomi: シュ、ス   Kun-Yomi: まも.る、まも.り、もり、-もり、かみ  	Examples: 守備 (しゅび), 保守 (ほしゅ), 攻守 (こうしゅ), 守る (まも.る), 守 (もり)"

Per-factum suggests something so ""thoroughly made or done"" that nothing more needs to be added to it. Now look at the kanji, which does something similar. We see a house that has been made perfectly from its beginnings in the foundation to the roof on the top. Now return to frame 101 and make sure not to confuse this key word with the kanji for complete.

Think of the key word in its religious sense of missionary preaching: ""proclaiming the good news to all nations"" and ""shouting it from the housetops."" That should be enough to help you remember this simple kanji, used in fact both for traditional missionary work as well as for one of its contemporary replacements: advertising. 	 	 	You can proclaim your opinions from the comfort of your HOUSE and have it SPAN the entire globe these days via The Internet. 	 	On-Yomi: セン   Kun-Yomi: のたま.う、のたま.わく"

It does this by picturing a house with a candle in it. The reason is obvious: whoever is living there is ""burning the candle at both ends,"" and working night after night into the wee hours. 	 	 	I burn the CANDLE in my HOUSE until the WEE HOURS reviewing the kanji!!! 	 	On-Yomi: ショウ   Kun-Yomi: よい  	Examples: 宵 (よい)"

So indulge yourself in a Norman Rockwell image of relaxing after a hard day's work: the scruffy and weary woman of the house slouched asleep in the living room chair, her hair in curlers and a duster lying in her lap. 	 	 	It´s funny, Hesig gives no Kanji in his book that means cheap/inexpensive... well... if you were wondering what Kanji would carry that meaning, look no further. Sometimes I wonder if Hesig just thinks our little brains would be too easily confused by multiple meanings. Regardless, think of that woman relaxing. Cheapest place to do that is in one´s own home rather than at some fancy resort, eh? 家で休暇を取るは安いですね。. 	 	On-Yomi: アン   Kun-Yomi: やす.い、やす.まる、やす、やす.らか  	Examples: 安い (やす.い)"

Here we see a strange house - perhaps the haunted House of Usher that Edgar Allen Poe immortalized, or the enchanted Gingerbread House that lured Hansel and Gretel to draw near. 	 	 	The strange house has a sign saying ""DRAW NEAR"" in its window, instead of a ´Beware´ sign. It must be a trick! 	 	On-Yomi: キ   Kun-Yomi: よ.る、-よ.り、よ.せる  	Examples: 寄せる (よ.せる), 寄る (よ.る)"

In keeping with the story introduced back then, note how all the wealth is kept under the roof of the same house. 	 	 	Remember Ducktales? That rich duck had that room in his house where he kept all the wealth! He had so much in that house you could even swim in it!

The only difference is that our currency is not paper bills but shells, a not uncommon unit of exchange in older civilizations. The nail under the roof of the house points to a hiding place in the rafters on which one strings up one's shells for safekeeping. 	 	 	It takes a lot more than one clam of savings to buy a house on a street. 	 	On-Yomi: チョ   Kun-Yomi: た.める、たくわ.える"

The final two strokes sweep down in both directions to indicate the roots. Although it may look similar at first sight to the kanji for water (Frame 137), the order in which it is written is completely different and this affects its final appearance. 	  * As a primitive, this kanji can be used to mean tree or wood. In those cases where the last two strokes are detached from the trunk, we shall change its meaning to pole, or wooden pole. 	 	If you need a story for a tree, then you need to be hit by one.

A grove is a small cluster of trees. Hence the simple reduplication of the kanji for tree gives us the grove. 	 	 	A grove has at least two TREEs. 	 	On-Yomi: リン   Kun-Yomi: はやし  	Examples: 林 (はやし)"

Using the primitives as our guide, we define it as a tree with ivy growing down its branches in the shape of a hangman's rope. 	 	 	Simple mnemonic : ""The Japanese Judas-tree is the tree on which Judas hang himself to the ivy"" (Judas the traitor of the Christian bible). Just picture Judas hanging himself, using ivy as a if it was a rope. 	 	On-Yomi: ケイ   Kun-Yomi: かつら"

As you may recall, what made the sacred oak in the forest of Diana the Huntress outside of Rome ""golden"" were the white berries of the mistletoe that grew in the branches of the tree. When the light of the sun shone through them, they turned yellow and the branch to which they clung appeared to be made of gold. (If you don't know the story, take a break today and hunt it down in a dictionary of myth and fable. Even if you forget the kanji - which of course you won't - the story of the mistletoe and the fate it brought to Balder the Beautiful is most memorable.) 	 	 	The wood from oak trees can be used to make barrels in which white wine is aged. What´s more, I love white wine with an oaky flavour... 	 	On-Yomi: ハク、ヒャク、ビャク   Kun-Yomi: かしわ"

Then think of that line as made of very thin wood; and finally note how each time the line bends it forms a 90° angle, thus giving us the nine and the ten. 	 	 	wood at 90 (9 * 10) degrees.

Fixing candles to the branches of evergreen trees, it was believed, would lure the sun back (like things attracting like things), whence the custom of the lighted tree that eventually found its way into our Christmas customs. The story is a lot longer and more complex than that, but it should help to fix the image of climbing high up into the treetops to fix candles on the tree. 	 	 	At Christmas time, on the treetops, people used to place great big candles (Now we usually place a star instead). 	 	On-Yomi: ショウ   Kun-Yomi: こずえ、くすのき"

The reasons should be obvious: it is made of the same stuff, wood, and spends a lot more time with them than we do! Here again, be careful not to let the rationality of the explanation get in the way before you turn it into a proper story. 	 	 	A shelf is a wooden companion to books.

It is a short step to associate the tree with the monks to its right. (For the curious, the name of this oriental tree really comes from a Russian princess, Anna Pavlovna.) 	 	 	In Japan, a paulownia (きり）is known as the ""princess tree"". It was once a traditional TREE planted at the SAME time as the birth of a daughter.

The more proper way to plant a young tree and give it a fair shake in life is to set it into the earth in such a way that it can grow up straight. 	 	 	Plants don´t become trees straightaway.

Usually this is due to simple old age, as this character shows us. Be sure to picture a wrinkled old tree, withering away in a retirement center so that the commonsense explanation does not take over. 	 	 	A tree withers away as it gets old.

For the magic of the wand derives its power from its association with the hidden laws of nature, and needs therefore to be kept in its crude, natural state. 	 	 	Wooden wands are the crudest. They are nothng compared to their carbon fibre equivilents. 	 	On-Yomi: ボク   Kun-Yomi: ほう、ほお、えのき"
town	"town 	 	村   	   	Lesson: 10   Frame: 221   Strokes: 7   —   Jouyou Grade: 1   JLPT: 2   	Constituents: town, tree, wood, measure, glue 	 	The character for village was associated with rice fields (Frame 96). That for town, a step up on the evolutionary path to cities, shows a circle of trees glued together to measure off the confines of a town. 	 	 	If you´ve ever played an old 8 bit or 16 bit RPG, like Dragon Warrior or Final Fantasy or Inindou, you´ll remember that every town was all bordered off by a line of trees with no space in between to get out through. Imagine that the trees were glued together so you could only exit town through the main or side gates, (so you couldn´t escape the important scripted scenes.).

From there we read off the elements: tree . . . eye. With only a slight leap of the imagination, those two words call to mind the scriptural proverb about first taking the block of timber out of one's own eye before helping your neighbors with the splinter in theirs. What more useful rule for inter-human relationships, and what more useful tool for remembering this kanji! 	 	 	The prime minister is having inter-course behind that tree! All you can see are his eyes poking out from the righthand-side of the tree. 	 	On-Yomi: ソウ、ショウ   Kun-Yomi: あい-  	Examples: 相当 (そうとう), 相談 (そうだん), 真相 (しんそう), 相 (あい)"

These two elements, written in that order, dictate how to write the character. 	 	 	My wooden desk is so messy, it looks like a strong wind blew my things all over it.

Can you seethe ""cross-cut"" in the trunk of the tree? Picture it as a chainsaw cutting you out a few books with which to start your own private library. 	 	 	The origin of a book is paper made out of TREEs. ONE tree can make many books. 	 	On-Yomi: ホン   Kun-Yomi: もと  	Examples: 本 (もと)"

Next time you see one, imagine the bit of wire that fixes the tag to the branch as a large fishhook. REALLY imagine it, illogical as it is, and you will never have trouble with this kanji again. 	 	 	Botanists like to identify TREEs by HOOKing tags on them. 	 	On-Yomi: サツ   Kun-Yomi: ふだ  	Examples: 札 (ふだ)"
calendar	"calendar 	 	暦   	   	Lesson: 10   Frame: 226   Strokes: 14   —   Jouyou Grade: JH   JLPT: 1   	Constituents: calendar, cliff, grove, tree, wood, sun, day, tree2, wood2 	 	Look at this character in reverse order, from bottom up. First we see the primitive for days, an appropriate enough way to begin a calendar. Next we see a grove of trees growing under a cliff. The laws of nature being what they are, the trees would be stunted under such conditions, unless they were strong enough to keep growing upwards until they passed through the layers of rock and soil, right up to the surface. Now imagine that in those little boxes marking off the days on your wall calendar, you see that very process taking place step by step: 365 or so time-lapse pictures of that grove of trees each month, from January under the cliff to December on top of the cliff. The story is not as complex as it sounds, particularly if you happen to have a calendar nearby and can flip through it with this image in mind. 	 	 	Years-Months-Days: It takes many years for a cliff to form or erode. A tree takes many months to grow. But days pass by regularly - so in this way, we see the movement of time such as with a CALENDAR. 	 	On-Yomi: レキ   Kun-Yomi: こよみ、りゃく  	Examples: 暦 (こよみ)"
plan	"plan 	 	案   	   	Lesson: 10   Frame: 227   Strokes: 10   —   Jouyou Grade: 4   JLPT: 1   	Constituents: plan, relax, house, woman, tree, wood 	 	Without much effort, the elements relax . . . tree suggest a hammock strung between two trees in your backyard, and you stretched out in it, hands folded behind your head, planning something or other. After all, it's something we all do from time to time: kick up our legs on the nearest piece of furniture and daydream about the best plan of action to take. Be sure to relate the relaxation to the tree, so that you don't end up with something else in its place (like ""legs"" or ""desk"" or ""table""). 	 	 	I plan to RELAX on top of that TREE.

parch	"parch 	 	燥   	   	Lesson: 10   Frame: 228   Strokes: 17   —   Jouyou Grade: JH   JLPT: 2   	Constituents: parch, fire, furniture, wooden goods, mouth, tree, wood, mouth3 	 	Parchment, made from animal skins, was the most common form of writing material used until the beginning of the nineteenth century. When paper took over, a method was devised to make artificial parchment from wood pulp. The fire at the left and in the ""strong"" position serves to remind us of the root word, ""parch,"" since nothing dries, puckers, wrinkles, and scorches quite like fire. And here is how we put it all together. Take a sheet of paper (a ""wood-good,""), wet it, and hold it over a hearth in your mind's eye. Now watch as it parches the paper, leaving it with a strange and bumpy surface resembling parchment. 	 	 	Tip: goods + wood/tree : This combination of primitives appears four times in Heisig, so it´s worthwhile giving it a name. I suggest ""furniture"" (a common type of wooden goods). REF: parch (FRAME 215) , maneuver (#671), winding (#1369), seaweed (#2035). Story: It´s been so parched recently that your furniture suddenly catches fire. 	 	On-Yomi: ソウ   Kun-Yomi: はしゃ.ぐ"
not yet	"not yet 	 	未   	   	Lesson: 10   Frame: 229   Strokes: 5   —   Jouyou Grade: 4   JLPT: 3   	Constituents: not yet, tree, wood, one 	 	As the key word suggests, this kanji has to do with something not quite over and done with. More concretely, it shows us a tree that is not yet fully grown. The extra short stroke in the upper branches shows new branches spreading out, leaving one with the feeling that the tree has a ways to go yet before it reaches maturity. In other words, the kanji conveys its meaning pictographically, playing on the earlier pictograph of the tree. 	 	 	I believe a better version of that by mameha1977: [Cheat] Remember these as a set: The tree (木) does not yet (未) have exremities (末) of vermilion (朱). 	 	On-Yomi: ミ、ビ   Kun-Yomi: いま.だ、ま.だ、ひつじ"
extremity	"extremity 	 	末   	   	Lesson: 10   Frame: 230   Strokes: 5   —   Jouyou Grade: 4   JLPT: 3   	Constituents: extremity, tree, wood, one 	 	This character is best learned in connection with that of the previous frame. The first stroke shows a branch that is longer than the main branch, indicating that the tree has reached the extremity of its growth, so that its branches stop spreading and start drooping downwards. Be sure to keep this imagery in mind, to avoid confusing this key word with synonyms that will appear later. 	 	 	The tree has reached the extremity of its growth and no longer produces small, new branches at the top. Instead the existing top branch just grows longer and longer. 	 	On-Yomi: マツ、バツ   Kun-Yomi: すえ  	Examples: 末代 (まつだい), 本末 (ほんまつ), 粉末 (ふんまつ), 末 (すえ)"
splash	"splash 	 	沫   	   	Lesson: 10   Frame: 232   Strokes: 8   —   Jouyou Grade: Names   JLPT:    	Constituents: splash, water, water droplets, water pistol, extremity, one, tree, wood 	 	The splash this kanji refers to is the dash of water against the rocks, with all the foam and spray that this creates. If you think of a splash in this sense as a wave that has run its full course and reached its extremity, namely the seashore, and if you think of it pictorially in your mind's eye, this somewhat rare (but oh so-easy-to-learn) kanji is yours for good. 	 	 	The extremity of a wave of water is the splash. 	 	On-Yomi: マツ、バツ   Kun-Yomi: あわ、しぶき、つばき"
flavor	"flavor 	 	味   	   	Lesson: 10   Frame: 233   Strokes: 8   —   Jouyou Grade: 3   JLPT: 4   	Constituents: flavor, mouth, not yet, one, tree, wood 	 	When a tree has not yet finished growing, it produces fruit with a full flavor. When the official taster (the professional mouth to the left) determines that full flavor has been reached, the tree is pruned back so that it remains permanently not yet grown. A neat little agricultural trick and an easy to way see the sense of flavor hidden in this character. 	 	 	My mouth has not yet swallowed the food because the flavor is so delicious that I keep chewing it. 	 	On-Yomi: ミ   Kun-Yomi: あじ、あじ.わう  	Examples: 味 (あじ), 味わう (あじ.わう)"

My younger sister is NOT YET a fully grown WOMAN. 	 	On-Yomi: マイ   Kun-Yomi: いもうと  	Examples: 妹 (いもうと)"
vermilion	"vermilion 	 	朱   	   	Lesson: 10   Frame: 235   Strokes: 6   —   Jouyou Grade: JH   JLPT: 1   	Constituents: vermillion, drop, not yet, one, tree, wood 	 	That red-orange color we call vermilion is found in nature during the fall when the leaves lose their sugar and begin to change color. This kanji depicts the very last leaf on a tree in the fall (the drop hung in the first stroke), the leaf that has not yet fallen as it one day must. Look at its color - vermilion. (Well, not really. The truth is, vermilion is made from a mercuric sulfide, but I'm sure you will agree that autumn leaves area lot easier to work with.) 	 	 	It´s autumn: only one vermilion leaf on the tree has not yet fallen. 	 	On-Yomi: シュ   Kun-Yomi: あけ"
stocks	"stocks 	 	株   	   	Lesson: 10   Frame: 236   Strokes: 10   —   Jouyou Grade: 6   JLPT: 1   	Constituents: stocks, tree, wood, vermillion, drop, not yet, one, tree, wood 	 	The stocks bought and sold on the market by the tens of millions each day get their name from a comparison to a healthy tree, in which one takes ""stock"" in the hopes that it will grow and produce more and more trees like itself. Usually good stocks are referred to as ""blue chip,"" but here we are asked to associate the key word with the color vermilion, perhaps because one can assess the value of a tree from the color of its autumn leaves. 	 	 	Which tree would you buy stocks in - the healthy one on the left, or the one with only one vermilion leaf left on the right? 	 	On-Yomi: シュ   Kun-Yomi: かぶ  	Examples: 株 (かぶ)"
young	"young 	 	若   	   	Lesson: 10   Frame: 237   Strokes: 8   —   Jouyou Grade: 6   JLPT: 3   	Constituents: young, flowers, right, by one’s side, mouth 	 	Here we see a flower held in the right hand. You can imagine yourself in a magic garden where flowers picked with the right hand grant eternal youth; and those picked with the left, premature senility. Go ahead, pick one with each hand and watch what happens. 	 	 	The young little girl held a cute flower in her right hand. 	 	On-Yomi: ジャク、ニャク、ニャ   Kun-Yomi: わか.い、わか-、も.しくわ、も.し、も.しくは  	Examples: 若年 (じゃくねん), 若干 (じゃっかん), 自若 (じじゃく), 若しくは (も.しくは), 若い (わか.い)"
grass	"grass 	 	草   	   	Lesson: 10   Frame: 238   Strokes: 9   —   Jouyou Grade: 1   JLPT: 3   	Constituents: grass, flowers, sunflower, early, sun, day, ten, needle 	 	Perhaps you know the custom of seeding grass randomly or in some particular pattern with the flower called the crocus, which blooms for a few days each year in early spring. As the grass begins to turn green again after winter has passed, these tiny flowers dot up here and there. Now just look out your window at a patch of grass somewhere and think what a nice idea it would be to have your name spelled out in flowers once as a sort of early harbinger of spring. 	 	 	Grass grows in earlier than flowers. 	 	On-Yomi: ソウ   Kun-Yomi: くさ、くさ-、-ぐさ  	Examples: 草 (くさ)"
suffering	"suffering 	 	苦   	   	Lesson: 10   Frame: 239   Strokes: 8   —   Jouyou Grade: 3   JLPT: 3   	Constituents: suffering, flowers, old, tombstone, gravestone, church, ten, needle, mouth 	 	The picture of suffering we are given here is that of a flower that has grown old. When a flower ages, it pales and dries up, and probably even suffers. If you think that plants are incapable of such feelings, then ask yourself why so many people believe that talking to their flowers helps them bloom better. 	 	 	Flowers for the old man suffering in the hospital. 	 	On-Yomi: ク   Kun-Yomi: くる.しい、-ぐる.しい、くる.しむ、くる.しめる、にが.い、にが.る  	Examples: 苦しい (くる.しい), 苦しむ (くる.しむ), 苦しめる (くる.しめる), 苦い (にが.い), 苦る (にが.る)"
tolerant	"tolerant 	 	寛   	   	Lesson: 10   Frame: 241   Strokes: 13   —   Jouyou Grade: JH   JLPT: 1   	Constituents: tolerant, house, flowers, look, see, telescope, eye, human legs 	 	The house of flowers or ""hothouse"" has become a metaphor for a narrow-minded, biased, and intolerant attitude distrustful of change. Tolerance, in contrast, is open-minded and welcomes novelty. The way to encourage tolerance in those who lack it is first to have them see through their own hothouse attitudes, which is the very counsel we are given in this kanji. 	 	 	A tolerant person will ignore SEEing GRASS (marijuana) in the HOUSE of a friend. 	 	On-Yomi: カン   Kun-Yomi: くつろ.ぐ、ひろ.い、ゆる.やか"
dilute	"dilute 	 	薄   	   	Lesson: 10   Frame: 242   Strokes: 16   —   Jouyou Grade: JH   JLPT: 2   	Constituents: dilute, flowers, water, water droplets, water pistol, acupuncturist, specialty, drop, ten, needle, rice field, brains, glue 	 	Take a good look at this kanji: the ""strong"" element here is really the flower, not the water as you might have thought on first glance. To the right is the acupuncturist from frame 48. Taking the key word to connote diluting the vital humors of the body, we can imagine our acupuncturist performing his task with flowers in place of needles, and using their hollow stems to pipe water into the body of the patient. 	 	 	A Dr. missing his needle can only use dilute flower water for medicine. 	 	On-Yomi: ハク   Kun-Yomi: うす.い、うす-、-うす、うす.める、うす.まる、うす.らぐ、うす.ら-、うす.れる、すすき  	Examples: 薄い (うす.い), 薄まる (うす.まる), 薄める (うす.める), 薄らく (うす.らく), 薄れる (うす.れる)"
leaf	"leaf 	 	葉   	   	Lesson: 10   Frame: 243   Strokes: 12   —   Jouyou Grade: 3   JLPT: 3   	Constituents: leaf, flowers, Tarzan, generation, tree, wood 	 	Three elements are given here: flower . . . generation . . . tree. The first and last seem logical enough, since it is the leaf that feeds the flowers on a tree. The element for generation interposed between the two suggests that the movement of a tree from one generation to the next is like its ""turning over a new leaf."" 	 	 	On top of the leaves a flower appears, promising new generations for the old tree below. 	 	On-Yomi: ヨウ   Kun-Yomi: は  	Examples: 葉 (は)"
imitation	"imitation 	 	模   	   	Lesson: 10   Frame: 244   Strokes: 14   —   Jouyou Grade: 6   JLPT: 1   	Constituents: imitation, tree, wood, graveyard, flowers, sun, day, large, St. Bernard 	 	Ah, but haven't modern graveyards become a parody of their ancestors! The flowers are plastic, the writing on the stones is unimaginative and cold, and the whole thing looks more like a marble orchard than a right and proper graveyard. This kanji continues with the modernization trend by picturing imitation trees in the graveyard. But of course, how convenient! They don't need pruning or fertilizing, their leaves don't fall, and they remain the same color all year long. 	 	 	If I find out this furniture you´re selling me is made of imitation wood, I´ll put you in the graveyard. 	 	On-Yomi: モ、ボ   Kun-Yomi:   	Examples: 模範 (もはん), 模型 (もけい), 模倣 (もほう)"
vague	"vague 	 	漠   	   	Lesson: 10   Frame: 245   Strokes: 13   —   Jouyou Grade: JH   JLPT: 1   	Constituents: vague, water, water droplets, water pistol, graveyard, flowers, sun, day, large, St. Bernard 	 	Think of the key word as having to do with something viewed through a haze, or in the twilight and from a distance, so that only its outlines are vaguely discernible. Now we are back again to the essence of the true graveyard. The water may be taken as the sound of waves dashing up against the rocks or the dripping of moisture on cold rock - anything that helps you associate vagueness with the graveyard and keep it distinct from the imitation we met in the last frame. 	 	 	The precise locations of sailors who meet a WATERY GRAVE are vague. 	 	On-Yomi: バク   Kun-Yomi:"
grave	"grave 	 	墓   	   	Lesson: 10   Frame: 246   Strokes: 13   —   Jouyou Grade: 5   JLPT: 1   	Constituents: grave, graveyard, flowers, sun, day, large, St. Bernard, soil, dirt, ground 	 	The mounds of soil with crude wooden crosses set at their head suggests those boot-hill graves we all know from cowboy lore. The only odd thing about this kanji is that the soil comes UNDER the graveyard, rather than to its left, where we might expect. Just think of the bodies as ""lying under boot-hill"" if you have any trouble. By the way, this is not the first time, nor will it be the last, that we learn a kanji whose key word is the same, or almost the same, as a primitive element based on it, but whose shape differs somewhat. There is no cause to worry. By using the primitive in a variety of other characters, as we have done here, the confusion will be averted as a matter of course. In most cases, as here, the primitive element is taken from a part of the fuller kanji. 	 	 	The soil under a graveyard is full of graves. 	 	On-Yomi: ボ   Kun-Yomi: はか  	Examples: 墓 (はか)"
livelihood	"livelihood 	 	暮   	   	Lesson: 10   Frame: 247   Strokes: 14   —   Jouyou Grade: 6   JLPT: 3   	Constituents: livelihood, graveyard, flowers, sun, day, large, St. Bernard, sun2, day2 	 	Imagine that you have chosen the occupation of the keeper of a graveyard and spend your days tending to other's dead hood in order to make your means of livelihood. 	 	 	He made a livelihood out of robbing GRAVEYARDS in broad DAYlight. 	 	On-Yomi: ボ   Kun-Yomi: く.れる、く.らす  	Examples: 暮らす (く.らす), 暮れる (く.れる)"

But we save the word ""skin"" for another kanji, and use the odd word ""membrane"" here. Think of being so scared through and through that the goose flesh moves from the outside in, giving you goose membranes. 	 	 	In the moonlight of the graveyard I hear a zombie say, MMMMM..EMM...BRANEsssss. 	 	On-Yomi: マク   Kun-Yomi:"

Then you need only imagine them taking root and breaking out into flower right through the tops of the skulls of people walking around on the streets. 	 	 	If you plant seedlings in a FIELD eventually they will FLOWER. 	 	On-Yomi: ビョウ、ミョウ   Kun-Yomi: なえ、なわ-  	Examples: 苗 (なえ)"

Think of reading turtle shells as a way to foretell the future, and in particular things that portend coming evils. 	  * When this character is used as a primitive in its full form, we keep the key-word sense of a portent. When it appears to the left in its abbreviated form (namely, the left half only), we shall give it the pictographic sense of a turtle. 	 	When your wife´s LEGs get huge hairs on them it is surely a bad portent for things to come. 	 	On-Yomi: チョウ   Kun-Yomi: きざ.す、きざ.し  	Examples: 兆し (きざ.し), 兆す (きざ.す)"
peach tree	"peach tree 	 	桃   	   	Lesson: 11   Frame: 251   Strokes: 10   —   Jouyou Grade: JH   JLPT: 1   	Constituents: peach tree, tree, wood, portent, turtle 	 	To associate the peach tree with the primitive for a portent, recall the famous Japanese legend of Momotarō, the Peach Boy. It begins once upon a time with a fisherman and his wife who wanted badly to have a child, but none was born to them. Then one day the old man caught a giant peach, out of which jumped a healthy young lad whom they named Peach Boy. Though the boy was destined to perform heroic deeds, his birth also portended great misfortune (how else could he become a hero?). Thus the tree that is associated with a portent of coming evil comes to be the peach tree. 	 	 	The pits of a peach tree look like turtles. 	 	On-Yomi: トウ   Kun-Yomi: もも  	Examples: 桃 (もも)"

The roots of the superstition are old and almost universal throughout the cultures of the world. In this kanji, too, being stared at is depicted as an eye that portends evil. 	 	 	Sauron´s One fiery eye stare at Frodo and it is a sign of portent. Evil will become whomever the eye is staring upon. 	 	On-Yomi: チョウ   Kun-Yomi: なが.める  	Examples: 眺める (なが.める)"

In this frame we finally see why. The drop added as a fourth and final stroke means that we have to do with a normal-sized dog, which compared to the St. Bernard is no more than a drop in the kennel. 	  * As a primitive this character can take two meanings. In the form given here it will mean a very small dog (which we shall refer to as a chihuahua for convenience sake). When it takes the form 犭 to the left of a character, we shall give it the meaning of a pack of wild dogs. 	 	A large dog, dripping drool. 	 	On-Yomi: ケン   Kun-Yomi: いぬ、いぬ-  	Examples: 犬 (いぬ)"

Like all classic stories of ill-fated love, this one shows how the young upset the status quo with an emotion older and more powerful than anything their elders have devised to counter it: blind love. 	 	 	It was left to the turtle to make right with the dog and thus maintain the status quo.. 	 	On-Yomi: ジョウ   Kun-Yomi:"
silence	"silence 	 	黙   	   	Lesson: 11   Frame: 255   Strokes: 15   —   Jouyou Grade: JH   JLPT: 1   	Constituents: silence, black, computer, chihuahua, dog, large, drop, oven-fire, barbecue 	 	Oddly enough, the character for silence shows us a black chihuahua. Actually, the cute little critter's name is Darkness, as I am sure you remember from the famous song about silence that begins, ""Hello, Darkness, my old friend...."" Note how the four dots reach all the way across the bottom of the character. 	 	 	The computer won´t stop beeping, which is making the chihauhua bark, and it´s driving this guy insane. The only solution he can come up with is to throw them both on the fire and finally enjoy the silence. 	 	On-Yomi: モク、ボク   Kun-Yomi: だま.る、もだ.す  	Examples: 黙る (だま.る)"
sort of thing	"sort of thing 	 	然   	   	Lesson: 11   Frame: 256   Strokes: 12   —   Jouyou Grade: 4   JLPT: 3   	Constituents: sort of thing, moon, crescent moon, month, flesh, part of the body, chihuahua, dog, large, drop, oven-fire, barbecue 	 	The key word in this frame refers to a suffix that gives the word before it an adjectival quality; hence we refer to it as ""sort of thing."" Reverting to the time when dog was more widely eaten than it is today (See frame 127), we see here a large cauldron boiling over an oven flame with the flesh of a chihuahua being thrown into the whole concoction to make it into a ""hot-diggity, dog-diggity"" sort of thing. 	 	 	Flesh of a dog over a cooking fire = ""hotdog"". There are all sorts of things in hot dogs. Believe me, you don´t want to know what sort of things . Visualize the hotdog curling as it cooks, to remember the unusual way the flesh primitive curves in this kanji. (tweaked version of ziggr´s. Thanks!).

This might just turn out to be a good way to get rid of a troublesome pack of wild dogs: lure them into a swamp of these reeds with the cattail flowers and then set fire to the swamp. Take care to focus on the flower rather than the ""cattail"" to avoid confusion with frame 259 below. 	 	 	REEDS are the only FLOWERS that WILD DOGS like to FIRE up and smoke while they are playing poker. 	 	On-Yomi: テキ   Kun-Yomi: おぎ"

If you imagine yourself failing at the task, you will probably have a stronger image than if you try to picture yourself succeeding. 	 	 	Actually when hunting it may be a good idea to use a pack of dogs as your personal guard. 	 	On-Yomi: シュ   Kun-Yomi: か.る、か.り、-が.り  	Examples: 狩り (か.り), 狩る (か.る)"

If you begin from the key word and think of a ""crop of cats,"" you will not confuse this story with the apparently similar story of two frames ago. 	 	 	The cat hid in the FLOWERS of the FIELD from the WILD DOGs. 	 	On-Yomi: ビョウ   Kun-Yomi: ねこ  	Examples: 猫 (ねこ)"
cow	"cow 	 	牛   	   	Lesson: 11   Frame: 260   Strokes: 4   —   Jouyou Grade: 2   JLPT: 4   	Constituents: cow 	 	Can you the ""doodle"" of a cow that has just been run over by a steamroller? The small dot in the first stroke shows its head turned to one side, and the next two strokes, the four legs. 	  * As a primitive, the same sense of cow is kept. Note only that when it is placed OVER another element, its tail is cut off. In this case, and when the element appears on the left, the stroke order is changed. 	 	A cow tried to climb up a vermilion tree, but in doing so, it broke its two bottom branches off. 	 	On-Yomi: ギュウ   Kun-Yomi: うし  	Examples: 牛 (うし)"

Anyway, we shall let the key word of this frame refer to something in a special class all its own - like the sacred cows of India that wander freely without fear of being butchered and ground into hamburger. Even though the practice is originally a Hindu one, and in any case no longer followed among the majority of Japanese Buddhist monks, the Buddha's refusal to take the life of any sentient being makes it only fitting that the cows should be placed on the sacred grounds of a Buddhist temple in this kanji. 	 	 	Think of not special people, but special animals. The sacred Hindu cows are special - they can wander around the temple without fear of becoming roast beef. 	 	On-Yomi: トク   Kun-Yomi:"

This character depicts revelation through the mouth of a cow, suggesting oracular utterances about truths hidden to human intelligence. 	 	 	The revelation makes the cow´s mouth drop down, ""Hamburgers are made of what?!"". 	 	On-Yomi: コク   Kun-Yomi: つ.げる  	Examples: 告げる (つ.げる)"

If you have a cow with human legs, as the elements show us here, it can only be because you have two people in a cow-suit. I always thought I'd prefer to be the one standing before, rather than the one that holds up the rear and becomes the ""butt"" of everyone's laughter. 	 	 	I´ve never seen a cow with human legs before! 	 	On-Yomi: セン   Kun-Yomi: さき、ま.ず  	Examples: 先 (さき)"

But we have already decided we will not allow such rationalism to creep into our stories. Not even this once. Instead, let us change the character from the Peanuts comic strip called ""Pigpen,"" who is always preceded by a little cloud of dust and grime, and rename him ""Wash-Out."" Everywhere he walks, a spray of water goes before him to sanitize everything he touches. 	 	 	In Japan, you always wash with water from the shower before you enter the bathtub.

First notice the vertical strokes: on the left is the curved umbrella handle, and on the right the straight walking stick. Now try to imagine the two parties tugging at their respective properties like two kids on a wishbone, creating a scene at the entrance of an elegant restaurant. 	 	 	The two strokes at the bottom look like a J and I, which stands for ""jammed in."". 	 	On-Yomi: カイ   Kun-Yomi:"

Imagine yourself taking an air flight over a world so densely populated that every bit of it is sectioned off like a gigantic checkerboard (the rice fields). If you look closely at the character, you should be able to see a kind of movement taking place as still more is being jammed into that already narrow space. 	 	 	One Japanese farmer I know is so small minded that he thinks the entire world is JAMMED IN the borders of his little RICE FIELD. 	 	On-Yomi: カイ   Kun-Yomi:"

But the tea plant itself has its own flowers, which can be quite beautiful and add a special flavor to the tea, as the Chinese found out already over 4,598 years ago. With the image of a terrace of flowering tea bushes in mind, picture a number of brightly painted and very l-o-n-g wooden poles (Frame 207) placed here and there in their midst, with a tiny umbrella at the top to shade the delicate-tasting tea flowers. 	 	 	Some people think drinking tea is boring and quaint. That´s why I spice mine up by adding a cocktail umbrella, which of course is made from a wood-en toothpick supporting a paper umbrella with flowers printed on top.

We all know what happens when there is no meeting of minds and when people's ideas don't fit with one another. But this kanji invites us to imagine what would happened to the romance of a certain unfortunate couple whose mouths didn't fit. 	 	 	I wouldn´t mind a meeting of mouths with her, she´s really fit !

The two sides combine to create a great pagoda made of dirt, with flowers by the tens of thousands fitted together for the roofing of each of the layers. Be sure to put yourself in the scene and fit a few of the flowers in place yourself so that the image works its way into memory with full force. 	 	 	In order to build a pagoda in this small Japanese garden everything has to fit: the soil to the left and the flowers in the upper right corner. 	 	On-Yomi: トウ   Kun-Yomi:"

You might even begin with the basic element for I beam and then try to fit the remaining third stroke in. 	  * As a primitive, this can mean either king or scepter, but it will usually be taken to mean ball, as an abbreviation of the character in the next frame. 	 	To be king you have to be a real crafty one ! 	 	On-Yomi: オウ、ノウ   Kun-Yomi:"

When it appears anywhere other than on the left side of a kanji, it takes the same shape as here. On the left, it will be lacking the final stroke, making it the same as the character in the previous frame. 	 	The king is said to have only one family jewel below the belt...

While the things we treasure most are usually of sentimental value, we take the original sense of the term treasure here and make it refer to jewels kept in one's house. 	 	 	On treasure island is a single house - where all the jewels are stored. 	 	On-Yomi: ホウ   Kun-Yomi: たから  	Examples: 宝 (たから)"

Think of the most enormous pearl you have ever seen, a great vermilion-colored ball sitting on your ring and making it extremely difficult to move without falling over from the weight of the thing. 	 	 	The king of the Oysters produces special Vermillion pearls! 	 	On-Yomi: シュ   Kun-Yomi: たま"

The kanji gives us a ball in which we see the present - obviously a crystal ball that enables us to see things going on at the present in faraway places. 	 	 	The KING ... can SEE clearly the PRESENT state of affairs in the land. (maybe he hees them in the crystal ball on the left?).

Sometimes the transformation is only a temporary phenomenon, sometimes it is permanent. In the latter case, the poor chap takes off on all fours to live with the beasts. To remember this kanji, imagine one of these lycanthropes going looney and setting himself up as king of a pack of wild dogs that roams about and terrorizes innocent suburban communities. 	 	 	Oh no ! A pack of dogs has bitten the king. He has turned into a rabid lunatic ! 	 	On-Yomi: キョウ   Kun-Yomi: くる.う、くる.おしい、くるお.しい  	Examples: 狂う (くる.う), 狂おしい (くる.おしい)"

The white bird perched above the king, elevating him to imperial heights, is the messenger he sends back and forth to the gods to request advice and special favors, something that white birds have long done in folklore throughout the world. 	 	 	Ancient Rome had Emperors instead of Kings, and they wore white robes. Thus an emperor is a king in white. (make sure you picture a roman emperor not a japanese one and you´ll be ok).

If we think of display in terms of that famous line, and the king with his head thrown back and his mouth wide open as 4 and 20 blackbirds fly in one after the other, we shall have satisfied both the elements and their position. 	 	 	The mouth of the king is displaying his bling. 	 	On-Yomi: テイ   Kun-Yomi:"

The kanji-image for wholeness depicts being ""king under your own umbrella,"" that is, giving order to your own life. I know it sounds terribly abstract, but what could be more abstract than the word whole? 	 	 	The fat king hogs the whole space under his umbrella. (tweaked version of radical tyro´s story. ""fat"" makes a more vivid image for me.). 	 	On-Yomi: ゼン   Kun-Yomi: まった.く、すべ.て  	Examples: 全く (まった.く)"

Forgetting the abstract picture of the former frame, let us work with all the primitive units: tree . . . umbrella . . . ball. Imagine a tree with a faucet in the side out of which tennis balls are flowing, bouncing all over the ground by the hundreds. You fight your way up to it and shove your giant beach umbrella into the tree to plug it up. 	 	 	The fat king under his umbrella offers useless advice to the workers. ""You´ll need the whole tree to plug that gap"". Imagine a grossly fat, incompetent king under a parasol giving annoying advice to sweating workers who know what they´re doing. (I always have trouble bringing up the ""whole"" primitive. This story reminds me how to build that part. ). 	 	On-Yomi: セン   Kun-Yomi:"

The image of logic we are given is something like a central jewel in a computer, like the jewels in old clocks that keep them running smoothly. Try to picture yourself making your way through all the rams and roms and approaching this shining jewel, a chorus of voice sand a blast of trumpets in the background heralding the great seat of all-knowing logic. 	 	 	The king of LOGIC is the computer. 	 	On-Yomi: リ   Kun-Yomi: ことわり"

Fundamentally, it means only that every one of us is a bit (or drop) of a king in our own environment. As for the positioning of the elements, if you take care to ""read off"" the primitives in this way, you won't end up putting the drop down below, where it turns the kanji into a jewel. 	  * As a primitive element, we set the key word aside entirely and take it as a pictograph of a solid brass candlestick (with the drop representing the flame at the top). 	 	A lord is a little drop down from King in hierarchy. 	 	On-Yomi: シュ、ス、シュウ   Kun-Yomi: ぬし、おも、あるじ  	Examples: 主人 (しゅじん), 主権 (しゅけん), 施主 (せしゅ), 主 (おも), 主 (ぬし)"

What could be more ridiculous, or simpler, as a way to recall this kanji? 	 	 	Visualize an idiot trying to figure out how to extinguish a candle.

Carve it in imagination into the shape of a gigantic candlestick and your work is done. 	 	 	The main pillar in a house should be made of the biggest and strongest tree - the lord of the trees.

Anyway, we want to depict bars of gold bullion with an umbrella overhead to shade them from the heat (and perhaps to hide them as well). The bullion is made by melting down all the scepters of the kingdom, drop by drop, and shaping them into bars. 	  * As a primitive, it means not only gold but any metal at all. 	 	The fat king taking up the whole space under the umbrella actually isn´t fat - he just has two big gold bars hidden under his clothes.

Their special habit, made of protective metal, is distinguished by a row of copper buttons just like the ""cops"" they serve.

The odd thing is that your angling rod is a golden ladle which you are using to scoop goldfish out of a river.

Since we already expect that needles are made of metal, let us picture a set of solid gold darning needles to complete the kanji. 	 	 	Remember the story of the needle in the haystack.

It will help if you can recall the first time you had this done and the feelings you had at the time. 	 	 	A piece of metal with a name on it.

It was discovered that nervousness produced more sweat, indicating subconscious reactions when the truth was getting too close for comfort. Nowadays, people can take drugs that tranquillize them in such a way as to neutralize the effect of the device, which is why other means have had to be developed. 	 	 	Tranquilize - using a metal syringe to get the truth. 	 	On-Yomi: チン   Kun-Yomi: しず.める、しず.まる、おさえ  	Examples: 鎮まる (しず.まる), 鎮める (しず.める)"

The primitives read: the neck of a road. Think of a crowded road-way where traffic has come to a standstill - what we commonly refer to as a ""bottleneck."" 	 	 	When we go out on the ROAD-WAY, we often risk our own necks (that´s why I take the train! ). 	 	On-Yomi: ドウ、トウ   Kun-Yomi: みち  	Examples: 道路 (どうろ), 道徳 (どうとく), 報道 (ほうどう), 道 (みち)"

(Since the turtle is on the road and not on the left, it can keep its full kanji shape as given in frame 250.) 	 	 	I used my pants to make a rope, which I then used to escape from prison; hence the naked, hairy legs running along the road!

You could, if you were an ecologically-minded terrorist. 	 	 	Caution: this kanji doesn´t mean environment; it means ""environs; boundary; border; vicinity"". To separate the environs, create the border by placing daggers on the road. 	 	On-Yomi: ヘン   Kun-Yomi: あた.り、ほと.り、-べ  	Examples: 辺境 (へんきょう), 周辺 (しゅうへん), その辺 (そのへん), 辺り (あた.り), 辺 (べ)"

Look for the front and back wheels (the first and last horizontal strokes) and the seat in the carriage in the middle. As an exercise, try to isolate the primitives on your own and make a story out of them. 	  * Car, cart, wagon, and vehicle may all be used as primitive meanings. 	 	My car is so fast it can go through ten rice fields in ten minutes. 	 	On-Yomi: シャ   Kun-Yomi: くるま  	Examples: 車 (くるま)"

The image of the car on the road should ground your image for picking up your friends to take them along to wherever you are going. 	 	 	When you put your car on the road you should always take along a few friends. Don´t confuse with carry (#303).

Begin with the car whose tires get caught in a rut and spin without going anywhere. Then go onto the baseball team who can't win a game because it has fallen into a rut of losing. 	 	 	My car got so stuck in a rut it required nine people pushing to get it out again. 	 	On-Yomi: キ   Kun-Yomi:"

On the right, we see a new tangle of elements that need sorting out. The first three strokes, you will remember, are the primitive for meeting. Below it we see the elements for flesh and saber, which combine to create a compound element for a butcher and his trade. Together they give us the image of a ""trucker's convoy."" 	 	 	The car is a cattle-car, used to transport animals for the butcher´s meeting - a convention on new butchering techniques. Hear the screams of the animals as it pulls up in front of the convention hall, where the butchers are waiting with their knives out front. 	 	On-Yomi: ユ、シュ   Kun-Yomi:"

Picture the butcher hacking away with his knife at a slab of meat on his table with a pair of ram's horns placed in front of him (or on his head, if you prefer). There is no need to worry about confusing this kanji with that for before (Frame 263), since it will not appear as a primitive in any other character used in this book.

A certain disease of the English language makes it almost impossible to translate the phrase without gender bias. In any event, here we see someone walking with his/her mouth between his/her walking legs, giving us an image of ""To each his/her own."" 	  * The sense of the proverb should help when using this kanji as a primitive; otherwise, reduce it to its original elements. But do not associate it in any way with the word ""every,"" which we shall meet later in another context. 	 	Son, I´ve never told you this but each woman has a second mouth between their fiiiiiine walking legs. 	 	On-Yomi: カク   Kun-Yomi: おのおの  	Examples: 各 (おのおの)"

Ranger! I want you to go check the status of each tree. ""Errr, Each tree sir?"" replies the ranger looking out over the vast forest. ""That´s Right, I want the status of each tree! Move out!"".

Needless to say, the ""stronger"" primitive - thatis to say, the simpler and more often used one - takes the dominant position on the left, even though the story would read them off the other way around. 	 	 	There are so many abbreviations and acronyms nowadays that no brain can remember each of them. Mnemonic: ab-brain-each-ation. 	 	On-Yomi: リャク   Kun-Yomi: ほぼ、おか.す、おさ.める、はかりごと、はか.る、はぶ.く、りゃく.す、りゃく.する"

Here, however, you are told to look above the eyes to the forehead of your guest. 	 	 	Sign the guestbook page with your forehead. (Picture a guestbook full of forehead prints like thumbprints).

Note how the walking legs (instead of ""animal legs"") are the only thing that distinguishes this character from that for page (Frame 64). 	 	 	In SUMMER you are hot from the top of your head down to your walking legs. 	 	On-Yomi: カ、ガ、ゲ   Kun-Yomi: なつ  	Examples: 夏季 (かき), 初夏 (しょか), 盛夏 (せいか), 夏 (なつ)"

The best way to dispose of a nasty bit of wind is to let it go and use those walking legs to dissapear. Nobody will ever know it was you. 	 	On-Yomi: ショ   Kun-Yomi: ところ、-こ、お.る"

The flower petals over the eyes (instead of the ""sand"" that Westerners are used to finding there when they awake in the morning) only confirms the image of a pleasant dream suggested by the rest of this rather complex kanji. 	 	 	Last night´s date with Miss Sweden was like a dream. She even laid flowers over my eyes to crown the perfect evening. 	 	On-Yomi: ム、ボウ   Kun-Yomi: ゆめ、ゆめ.みる、くら.い  	Examples: 夢 (ゆめ)"

Two little aliens in a trenchcoat and top hat, trying to look TALL. The bottom one, in the glass helmet, is under the coat.

The cottage is so small - it has an umbrella for the roof; soil for the floor and room for only one mouth. 	 	On-Yomi: シャ、セキ   Kun-Yomi: やど.る"

This is so you can use it to calculate the circumference of your motorcycle helmet: just begin at a fixed point and turn the lidded crock around and around, keeping it flush against the side of the helmet, until you come back to your starting point. If you kept track of how many turns and part-turns your lidded crock made, you now know the circumference. 	  * As a primitive, this character can take the added significance of a lap. 	 	If my LIDDED CROCK has the same CIRCUMFERENCE as my head, I like to use it as a HELMET. 	 	On-Yomi: シュウ   Kun-Yomi: まわ.り  	Examples: 周り (まわ.り)"

When feudalism collapsed, these warriors became Japan's gentlemen. 	  * The primitive meaning reverts to the more colorful image of the samurai, Japan's warrior class. 	 	What a handsome gentleman.

The samurai´s wife gives him a (uhum) before battle for good luck. 	 	On-Yomi: キチ、キツ   Kun-Yomi: よし  	Examples: 吉日 (きちじつ), 吉例 (きちれい), 大吉 (だいきち)"

The samurai happened to find an extra large crown that he wore as a belt on his waist, just above his legs. I wonder if he will sell it to me?

Anyone who has gone through the schooling system knows well enough that study is one thing and learning quite another again. In the kanji, too, the character for learning (Frame 616) has nothing to do with the schoolhouse. 	 	 	In the school house there are kids always studying. (BTW, atomiton, this is NOT 字).

In a schoolhouse in class: 1) you see something on the blackboard, then 2) you memorize it. 	 	On-Yomi: カク   Kun-Yomi: おぼ.える、さ.ます、さ.める、さと.る  	Examples: 覚える (おぼ.える), 覚ます (さ.ます), 覚める (さ.める)"

The TREES FLOURISH in the CLASSROOM, a little too much perhaps, there´s no room for the students any more.

And so it is that we have havens. 	 	 	A brush laying in dirty water is a haven for bacteria. 	 	On-Yomi: シン   Kun-Yomi: つ  	Examples: 津 (つ)"

Thus the taskmaster to the right forces the cow into a compromising position, so to speak, so that she and her mate can breed. 	 	 	Imagine a taskmaster giving a cow the command to ""start breeding, and start doing it now!"", except that the cow takes his advice a bit too literally and starts chasing the taskmaster to carry out this command! instead of finding another cow to breed with. Hence, you see the taskmaster running to the right, trying to stay ahead of the cow. 	 	On-Yomi: ボク   Kun-Yomi: まき  	Examples: 牧 (まき)"
aggression	"aggression 	 	攻   	   	Lesson: 15   Frame: 352   Strokes: 7   —   Jouyou Grade: JH   JLPT: 1   	Constituents: aggression, craft, taskmaster 	 	The special craft of successful taskmasters is their ability to remain constantly on the aggressive, never allowing their underlings a moment to ponder a counter-aggression of their own. 	 	 	Aggression is the craft of a good dominatrix. 	 	On-Yomi: コウ   Kun-Yomi: せ.める  	Examples: 攻める (せ.める)"

The kanji does this with a taskmaster whipping a tree into producing sheets against its will. 	 	 	The taskmaster is a strict bathroom monitor who hands out only one sheet of really rough, splintery toilet paper per person. You can see the wood fibers. 	 	On-Yomi: マイ、バイ   Kun-Yomi:"

It nearly always has its way. 	 	 	An OLD TASKMASTER is no happenstance (coincidence). The older you get the more rigid in your ways. 	 	On-Yomi: コ   Kun-Yomi: ゆえ、ふる.い、もと  	Examples: 故 (ゆえ)"

The taskmaster at the right is drilling you in the practice of your ""honorifics."" 	 	 	The flowery phrases of the schoolmaster held the students in awe. 	 	On-Yomi: ケイ、キョウ   Kun-Yomi: うやま.う  	Examples: 敬う (うやま.う)"

Hence the kanji for say has four little sound-waves, indicating the complexity of the achievement. 	  * This kanji, which appears often as a primitive, can mean saying, speech, or words, depending on which is most useful. 	 	A pictogram of someone saying a four letter word from their mouth after the censors have gotten a hold of it.

The idea of being admonished for something already sets up a superior-inferior relationship between you and the person you are supposed to stand in awe of. While you are restricted to answering in honorifics, the superior can use straightforward and ordinary words. 	 	 	To admonish is to enforce awe by means of words. 	 	On-Yomi: ケイ   Kun-Yomi: いまし.める"

A plot is a summary of a book that can be given in ten words. 	 	On-Yomi: ケイ   Kun-Yomi: はか.る、はか.らう  	Examples: 計らう (はか.らう), 計る (はか.る)"

And later (Frame 1517) we will meet another association of criminals with dogs. The prison here depicts a pack of wild dogs (the long-timers and hardened criminals) into which the poor little chihuahua (first offender) has been cast. The only thing he has to protect himself against the pack are his shrill and frightened words. 	 	 	The wild dog family visits their cousin in prison. They exchange words over the interphone at the visiting booth. 	 	On-Yomi: ゴク   Kun-Yomi:"

I said some bad words, and my mother chastised me by washing my mouth out with glue instead of soap! 	 	On-Yomi: トウ   Kun-Yomi: う.つ  	Examples: 討つ (う.つ)"

Even the etymology of the word instruction suggests the sense of ""pouring into"". 	 	 	The best type of Japanese INSTRUCTION is full immersion, which consists of going to Japan and swimming in the stream of words that surrounds you every day.

The mnemonic ""words to seduce the masses"" was just too vague and I kept forgetting it. So now instead I picture a seductive female reading aloud the imperial edict to the masses, thus ""seducing"" the masses. 	 	On-Yomi: ショウ   Kun-Yomi: みことのり  	Examples: 詔 (みことのり)"

The character sees the words as sealed tightly inside an aerosol can. 	 	 	WORDS of GOOD LUCK are PACKED into fortune cookies. 	 	On-Yomi: キツ、キチ   Kun-Yomi: つ.める、つ.め、-づ.め、つ.まる、つ.む  	Examples: 詰まる (つ.まる), 詰む (つ.む), 詰める (つ.める)"

Tales are always spoken, not written, and because of this, words fly out of your tongue, rather than your pen. 	 	On-Yomi: ワ   Kun-Yomi: はな.す、はなし  	Examples: 話す (はな.す), 話 (はなし)"

Listening to the words in a recitation of Vogon poetry is worse than spending an eternity in hell. [Note: I assume those 2 reports are to warn against possible confusion with poem (#346) but how can you confuse Vogon poetry with an actual poem? Anyway, it´s the next frame, so it should be easy to keep them straight... Or maybe there´s a kanji for Vogon in RTK3?]. 	 	On-Yomi: エイ   Kun-Yomi: よ.む、うた.う  	Examples: 詠む (よ.む)"

Perhaps this is why the records of the monks often read to us like poems. Before going on, back up a frame and make sure you have kept poem and recitation distinct in your mind. 	 	 	A poem is a temple of words. 	 	On-Yomi: シ   Kun-Yomi: うた"

You can see the clear distinction between I and words just by looking at the kanji. 	 	 	The simplest word to say is I. 	 	On-Yomi: ゴ   Kun-Yomi: かた.る、かた.らう  	Examples: 語らう (かた.らう), 語る (かた.る)"

A PETA activist speaks at a meeting of butchers to rebuke them. 	 	On-Yomi: ユ   Kun-Yomi: さと.す  	Examples: 諭す (さと.す)"

When the herds have all been driven to market, there is a great homecoming fiesta like that pictured here. As soon as the cowboys come home, home on the range, the first thing they do is kiss the ground (the mouth on the floor), and then get on with the fiesta. 	 	 	An astronaut lands back at the launch range, kisses the earth beneath him with his mouth, then heads off to a fiesta to celebrate a safe flight. 	 	On-Yomi: イキ   Kun-Yomi:"

By way of exception, the flowers take their normal place over the enclosure. 	 	 	The gay parade looks astonishing, as if overgrown with flowers. 	 	On-Yomi: モ   Kun-Yomi: しげ.る  	Examples: 茂る (しげ.る)"

What happens here is that the parade marching down main street turns into a dagger-throwing bout between competing bands. Note how only one stroke has to be added to make the change. 	 	 	It only takes a single stroke of a dagger for a parade to TURN INTO a bloodbath. 	 	On-Yomi: セイ、ジョウ   Kun-Yomi: な.る、な.す、-な.す  	Examples: 成功 (せいこう), 完成 (かんせい), 賛成 (さんせい), 成す (な.す), 成る (な.る)"

Take it as a rather crude drawing of a footprint: the first 3 strokes represent the front of the foot and the last the heel. The big toe (stroke 2 sticking out to the right) on the right indicates that this is a left foot. 	  * Although the meaning of stop will be retained, we will return often to the pictographic meaning of footprint. 	 	If you find in the ground a walking stick with a magic wand, STOP! Maybe it´s some kind of macumba/black magic/voodoo bad thing.

Instead of the grove making its way slowly through the surface of the cliff as before, here we see it stopped, much the same as a curriculum vitae calls a halt to the calendar and talks only about the past.

Here we see one footprint, complementing that proverb with the sound advice that if the first step is not made correctly, the whole point of the journey will be forfeited. This is the ideal that teachers are supposed to have in correcting their students, and parents in correcting their children. 	 	 	If you do it correct on the first attempt you can stop.

Think about what the primitives tell us. On the one hand, we see the pessimistic wisdom that politics has to do with taskmastering, maneuvering people with or without their will. And on the other, we see the campaign assurances that this duty can be performed correctly if only the right candidate is given a chance. 	 	 	Those involved in politics are always trying to elect the correct taskmaster. 	 	On-Yomi: セイ、ショウ   Kun-Yomi: まつりごと、まん  	Examples: 政治 (せいじ), 行政 (ぎょうせい), 家政 (かせい), 政 (まつりごと)"

Observe in the following frames how this kanji can embrace other elements from below, much the same way as the element for road does; and how, in order to do this, the final stroke needs to be lengthened. 	 	 	Hint: This kanji is NOT soil on top of mend, as Heisig claims - that would duplicate one of the strokes. Instead, it is 10 on top of mend.

Note the little ""hook"" at the end of the first stroke of the element for parade. This is the ONLY time it appears like this in the kanji treated in this book.

Build is easy to remember if you can remember that archtiechts have two steps in building. 1. Take a brush and brush out the blueprints. 2. Get a visual image of the blueprints all rolled up like they usually are. The second step is easy, it´s just the architecht stretching out the blueprints and showing it to his clients.

Be sure to get a concrete image of this process, by imagining yourself prolonging something you can really, physically, stretch. 	 	 	Stretching correctly prolongs life.

If you break the ""4-fold"" fold into 2 sets of 2 strokes, you will find it easier to remember. 	  * Used as a primitive, the additional meanings of cloak or scarf will come in handy. What has to be noted particularly are the changes in shape the kanji can undergo when it becomes an element in other kanji. In fact, it is the most volatile of all the kanji we shall treat, and for that reason deserves special attention here. When it appears to the left, it looks like a hiragana ne (ネ) with an extra drop on the right, and we shall take it to mean cloak. At the bottom, when attached to the stroke immediately above it, the first two strokes (the top hat) are omitted, which we shall take to mean a scarf. On rare occasions, the element can be torn right across the middle, with the first 2 strokes appearing at the top and the last 4 at the bottom of another primitive or cluster of primitive, in which cases we shall speak of a top hat and scarf. And finally, of course, it can keep its original kanji shape, along with its original meaning of garment in general. Note that when any of the above forms have something beneath them (as in frame 429), the third from final stroke is ""unhooked."" 	 	The only garments allowed in this club are top hat and scarf.

Although apparently the simplest of these first six kanji, when you begin to work on its plot and story you will soon find out that the number of strokes and visual complexity of a kanji does not make it easier or harder to remember. It is the primitives you have to work that are the critical factor, as in this case where the meaning of the key word is so seemingly distant from the elements. Remember, you can always break larger elements down (eye of a needle into eye and fishhook) if you think it helps. 	 	 	In Japanese this is KEN, as in Barbie´s boyfriend.

Taking careful note of the unusual stroke order that has the ""chimney"" on the house doubled up with the first stroke of the turkey, we may see the right side as a turkey house (or ""coop""). We shall see this pattern only on one other occasion (Frame 2093), but even for these two characters it is well worth the trouble to single it out as a primitive.

As dusk sets in, the flying horses all start yawning and pair off for the night: a perfectly delightful portrait of delight. 	 	 	Imagine a spoiled little girl.

Two things merit mention here. First, the doubling-up of the last stroke of head with the top of the crown serves to make the whole more aesthetically beautiful. It happens so rarely that the exceptions are easily learned. Second, try to make a single image out of the four elements. (Religious statuary of melancholy figures should offer plenty of suggestions.) 	 	 	Melancholy makes me think of Hamlet cause he was so ´emo´.

When the world´s most eminent magician died, everyone´s state of mind became that of lamentation. He was buried with his famous sun-flower wand in his hand.

Because of space restrictions, the element for go in is shortened in this character. If you stand on your head and look at this kanji, the image of a valley stands out more clearly: the mouth of the river whose water flows down at the intersection of the two mountains, with the final two strokes adding the element of perspective. Now get back on your feet again and see if the image still remains clear. If not, then return to the primitives and make a story in the usual way. 	 	 	This could be seen as a very accurate pictograph of another type of valley: a valley mouth open under the umbrella of inner labia, with the outer labia parted above. There are even more connections to be made among the primitive keywords and the visuals, but i will enter no further... 	 	On-Yomi: コク   Kun-Yomi: たに、きわ.まる  	Examples: 谷 (たに)"

The first stroke can then stand for something ""hanging"" down from the branch, namely its bark or pelt. The barb at the end of the second stroke is the only other change. Merely by concentrating on this as you write the following small cluster of characters should be enough to fix the form in your mind. By way of exception, you might doodle around with the kanji's form to see what you can come up with. 	 	 	A pelt is hooked on a branch. A small tent is made with a pelt and a branch planted in the ground. The mnemonic hints at the first stroke (the hanging pelt) and the hook at the end of the second stroke.

rice	"rice 	 	米   	   	Lesson: 26   Frame: 987   Strokes: 6   —   Jouyou Grade: 2   JLPT: 3   	Constituents: rice 	 	This kanji has a pictographic resemblance to a number of grains of rice lying on a plate in the shape of a star. 	  * As a primitive, it keeps its meaning of rice, and is meant to connote a very ordinary, commonplace grain, in contrast to the primitive for wheat that we just learned. (This meaning accords well with Japan, where the output of rice far exceeds that of wheat.) It occasionally takes a different shape when it stands on its own, or is joined to a line above. In this case, we shall have it refer specifically to grains of rice. This primitive is not to be confused with the similar-looking primitive for water. While the stroke orders are nearly alike, grains of rice has 5 strokes, while water only has 4 because it joins the second and third strokes into one. Finally, we may note that by itself the kanji for rice is an abbreviation used for the United States, which can then also serve as an alternate reading for the main primitive form, if you so wish. 	 	Stroke order: I like to think of the first two strokes as “chop sticks” with which one eats the rice. The rest then is the “tree” meaning “plant” in this contexct. also: USA.

The primitive meaning is another matter. The abstract notion of person so often has a relation to the meaning of the kanji that confusion readily sets in. So many of the previous stories have included people in them that simply to use person for a primitive meaning would be risky. We need to be more specific, to focus on one particular person. Try to choose someone who has not figured in the stories so far, perhaps a colorful member of the family or a friend whom you have known for a long time. That individual will appear again and again, so be sure to choose someone who excites your imagination. 	 	Behold Mister T (of ""A-Team"" fame)! I chose Mr.T because he´s sure to make amusing stories. He is a very versatile character since he´s both the big, tough guy and the “moralistic” person, telling kids not “to do drugs or alcohol”. He is easy to imagine, the heavy gold chains are probably the most prominent feature of the character. And last but not least you can always pepper your story with the famous line “I pity da foo!” * Fittingly, on the left side of the kanji, it looks like a “T”.

Its elements are: ceiling . . . sprout . . . shovel. 	 	 	You decide one day to paint a kanji on your ceiling. Unfortunately, you don’t have a brush, so, being innovative, you use a sprout. Knowing it could be messy, you search for a drop-cloth, but can’t find one. Instead, you put a shovel down on the floor to catch any drips resulting from the BRUSH-STROKEs.

If you think of them as deriving from the element for brains beneath (of course, the middle stroke has been reduplicated and pulled out to where it can be grabbed hold of), you can associate the key word with bending someone's mind to your own point of view. 	 	 	It looks like the mouth of Bender the robot, from Matt Groening´s animated series ""Futurama"". Thus, I use the character Bender the robot as a primitive.

By the way, it would make a rather large one, since the kanji is also used for a measure of about 18 liters! 	 	Since the meaning of ""big dipper"" is rather specific and the sense of measurement seems to be a more common usage, I concentrate on the primative meaning of measuring cup.

It referred to the nighttime travel of runaway slaves (those pent in) who had no maps other than the stars to guide them, among them the bright and predominant Big Dipper, the ""Drinking Gourd."" 	 	 	Can´t see direct relation to Big Dipper (#1177) since its writing order is completely different. As raulir noted, it´s written as overlapping at the last stroke of ツ and the first of メ.

Its composition is based on the nose (which, you will recall, is also the kanji for oneself). The extension of the bottom and far right strokes of that element, together with the unusual diagonal stroke, forms the pictograph of somebody with a prominent paunch. 	 	 	Somebody was just looking for you. He had a longnose that reaches down below his mouth, and a long jaw that sticks out past his nose, and a scar across his face. (greenapple,16-3-2006) The way to remember that this is somebody rather than someone (#1256) is that the story is full of body descriptions. 	 	On-Yomi: シン   Kun-Yomi: み  	Examples: 身 (み)"

The character for an old man begins with an abbreviation of the character for somebody, the nose having been shortened into a simple crisscross of lines. But there is another, simpler way to remember it all: the soil drawn first indicates that one has come close to the age when ""dust to dust"" begins to take on a personal meaning; the diagonal walking stick for getting around; and the spoon for being spoon-fed. 	  * As a primitive, the meaning is the same, but the final two strokes are omitted so that they can be replaced with other elements. 	 	An old man, wondering what it´s like in a grave, sits in a freshly dug plot. When a gravekeeper mistakes him for dead and begins burying him with soil, the old man saves himself by flailing his walking stick in the air.

This key word looks to be difficult because of its proximity to somebody. In fact, it is a very common kanji that will cause you no difficulty at all. Its meaning should be seen as the human referent for the abstract noun ""something."" 	  * As a primitive it means a puppet-on-a-string. 	 	I find the best way of memorizing this kanji is in conjunction with the Japanese compound for ninja: 忍者 -- i.e. someone who endures (see FRAME 597 for the kanji 忍).

Below that, we see one rake with two handles. Finally, we see a pair of strokes splitting away from each of the handles, indicating that they are both splitting under the pressure. The composite picture is of someone holding down two jobs concurrently, using the same kit of tools to move in two different directions and ending up in a mess. Take the time to find this sense in the kanji and it will be easy to remember, despite initial appearances. 	 	 	Our ninja hero, disguised as a gardener with a rake, is suddenly attacked from both left and right concurrently by bulls with animal horns. Our hero lets out a blood-curdling scream and tears his rake handle vertically in half, so he now has two wooden staffs (split rake handle) to fight with. He grips each staff (left side and right side) and rams it into the horns of the charging bulls. The force of each charging bull causes the tips of each staff to split again (split bottom of each rake handle). 	 	On-Yomi: ケン   Kun-Yomi: か.ねる、-か.ねる  	Examples: 兼ねる (か.ねる)"

So it is convenient to find the character for four in this kanji. But since we want only one of the four directions, the west adds the one at the top and sucks the human legs a bit out of their mouth in the process. 	  * As a primitive, the meaning of west can be expanded to refer to the Old West of cowboy-movie fame, just as the meaning of the character for east was expanded into the East. Note, however, that in its primitive form the legs are straightened out and reach down to the bottom of the mouth. Hence, we get the shape ⻃. With the exception of one kanji, given in the following frame, this element always appears at the top of its relative primitives. 	 	The old west represented by a completely empty whiskey bottle (compare sign of the bird (#1427) whiskey bottle about one third full).

The gates usually serve as an enclosure, and are written BEFORE whatever it is they enclose. 	  * As a primitive, we shall continue to give it the meaning of gates, but recommend the image of swinging doors (like the kind once common at entrances to saloons) to distinguish it from the primitive for door. 	 	Heisig´s stroke order in the 4th edition (and earlier) is wrong, so be careful -- first is the left-most vertical stroke, then draw the rest of the ""sun"" attachment as you would normally.

By lengthening the sixth and seventh strokes, you will see how this is done. 	  * The primitive meaning remains the same as that of the kanji, but special attention has to be given to the varieties of shape this element can undergo. It is the most difficult one you will meet in this book. When it appears BENEATH its relative primitive, the top three strokes are omitted, though the third horizontal stroke may be doubled up with the bottom horizontal stroke of the element above it.

Imagine things strung together like fish on a line, beads on a thread, or whatever. The main thing is to avoid putting them in a straight row, which would confound this element with the previous one. As we saw with bushel basket, this primitive can join its legs to the final horizontal stroke and stretch them to form an enclosure. 	 	The character for deluge (#1799) gave me the idea to use together as a primitive for Noah´s Ark.

The pictographic meaning we gave it there has no etymological relationship to this character, but use it if it helps. 	 	 	I see this kanji as a pictograph of a two story boat seen from the front. The glass canopy is the body of the boat. The drop on top is the chimney. The horizontal line is the ceiling/floor between the the 1st/2nd floor.

The silkworm (insect) eats the leaves of the mulberry bush (the flowers), digests them and transforms them into thread with which it spins about itself, in mystic wisdom, its own coffin (the hood). The dividing line that separates the two elements helps the picture of the little worm cutting itself off from contact with the outside world, but as a character stroke, it is a clear exception. 	 	 	This is a simple two-column manga showing the metamorphosis of a caterpillar into a cocoon. First, the caterpillar gets under a large flower (bees tend to hang around flowers, which scare away other predators). Then, in the first frame, we see the caterpillar (insect). Then, a bar separating this frame from the next frame (remember that Japanese manga run the other way!), in which we see the insect covered with thread, making a beautiful cocoon.

Next to it we see staples being held in mouth (one stroke is doubled up), indicating working in one's hobby or handicrafts at home on one's spare time. The small box at the top right is facing backwards, or more properly ""inside out."" Finally, we have the crotch at the bottom. 	 	 	Some jackass-like people have way too much spare time.

Its elements are: reclining . . . floor . . . fishhook . . . sheaf. Do not confuse with spirits (Frame 1930). 	 	 	You´re reclining on the floor trying to hook a sheaf with a small hook through the cracks. That you´ve been doing this for seven hours without success shows your burning spirit.

Rather than the biblical image of tying a millstone about the victim's neck, here we see a crown tied about one leg before the unfortunate party is tossed into the water. 	 	 	(thx geezer) The maimed waitress (no head and arms just her legs and trunk) is dropped into the water with a cement crown to make sure she sinks. She shouldn´t have been so nosy about her yakuza-boyfriend´s schemes. 	 	On-Yomi: チン、ジン   Kun-Yomi: しず.む、しず.める  	Examples: 沈む (しず.む), 沈める (しず.める)"

It shows a fellow in a top hat and scarf, trying hard to look happy by putting a walking stick in his mouth sideways to twist his face into a grotesque but semi permanent smile. 	 	 	If you thought that the dude in 哀 was pathetic, you haven´t seen him after his decline. Here he is carrying a stick around in his mouth like a dog, begging people to throw it for him. Note that the mouth is closed only after the stick goes in, as is only logical. 	 	On-Yomi: スイ   Kun-Yomi: おとろ.える  	Examples: 衰える (おとろ.える)"

You can think of this character forming as a pair with that of the former frame: there the in (the walking stick in the mouth) was set on its side; here it is set upright. 	 	 	The guy from pathetic (#401) shared his inmost feelings with a girl and she rammed a walking stick down his throat. It ruptured his inmost organs. 	 	On-Yomi: チュウ   Kun-Yomi:"

Think of the seats having been taken out so that they can be reupholstered with this decorated leather. 	 	 	I asked the street vendor the price of the LEATHER jacket.

The problem is what comes in between. It is formed by the character for complete, whose vertical stroke doubles up as the first stroke of water. 	 	 	Think of a picture of someone steaming vegetables. On top you see the flowers of cauliflower or something else that is being steamed. Underneath, the pan is completely full of water. Below the pan is a floor - that's the hotplate - and under that the oven fire. Caution: don't confuse with boil (#1257), or the steam radical in spirit (#1885).

Such an elegant turkey with a tusk. This mnemonic is meant to join RtK´s keyword with a better proposition.

This character refers to feudal clans that were abolished in 1871 (Meiji 4) in favor of prefectures (廃藩置県), and thus were predecessors of the modern prefectures.

After the drop at the outset, the next three strokes are completely novel and should be given special attention. 	 	 	In this kanji, you can see 3 katakana characters: ソ, ユ, and then ユ again followed by TAIL FEATHERS. STORY: ""So (ソ) you (ユ) wanna DO it?""

It seems that each of them knew how to make one part of the beast, so they pooled their talents and brought all the pieces (diced into pieces) together, at which point the fabricated tiger promptly ate its makers up (the bodiless human legs). Whatever the parable's significance for modern civilization and its arsenals, it should help with this kanji. Oh yes, we should not forget that cliff-like element. Think of it as an abbreviation of the primitive for zoo (the first and fourth strokes, actually), in order to fit the tiger somewhere into the picture. In fact, the abbreviation is perfectly logical, since the bottom elements usurp the room for the rest of the primitive for zoo. 	  * As a primitive element itself, the human legs are also swallowed up, but the meaning of tiger is kept, and the whole serves as a roof for what comes beneath 虍, giving the tiger something else to eat. 	 	Magic wand + first two strokes of pelt (皮) + diced + human legs. A wizard who turns people he doesn´t like into newts with his magic wand goes for variety - he has always wanted a tiger pelt - but things go awry when the tiger promptly dices and eats him, leaving only a pair of legs. (a fitting end for a wicked wizard). 	 	On-Yomi: コ   Kun-Yomi: とら  	Examples: 虎 (とら)"

Among them we find pictures of deer, some of them showing men in deer masks. By comparing their drawings to real deer, Stone Age people hoped to acquire power over the animal in the hunt; and by comparing themselves to the deer, to take on that animal's characteristics. But time has locked with a ""double-key"" (the extra stroke through the element for key) the real secret of this art form from us, and we can only surmise such meanings. But more important than the enigmas of the troglodytic mind is the way in which caves, a double-key, and comparing gives us the kanji for deer. 	  * As a primitive, this kanji is abbreviated much the same as the tiger was: the lower element is dropped to leave room for a replacement. Its meaning, however, remains the same. There are a very few cases (see frame 2158) in which there is no abbreviation. When this happens, we may keep the image suggested by the above explanation: painting of a deer.

Before we start, it is a good idea to keep the key word distinct from melancholy (Frame 663), with which it combines to create the psychological condition of depression (a metaphor based on the hollow or sinking of the material depression we met in Frame 1421). The picture of gloom begins with a small grove of trees, under which we see a crown made out of used tin cans. Next (the lower half of the kanji) we find a combination that appears only a few times in modern characters and only once in those treated in the volumes of Remembering the Kanji. It is composed of a shovel with a sheaf dotted with small drops on all sides. Think of it as a large scoop shovel attached to the front of a bulldozer, whose driver is singing: ♪ ""Bulldozing in the sheaves, bulldozing in the sheaves..."" ♪ The drops represent the chaff flying about as the sheaves are tossed about by the heavy machinery. There is someone sitting on the ground alongside, watching as the machinery makes its way around the neighboring farmland - and it's you, wearing your tin-can crown. You feel overwhelmed by the impending doom as the invasion of agro-business draws closer and closer to the grove, the only patch of woods that remains of what once was a vast forest. The whole scene represents a re-shaping of the natural environment that brings the heavy weight of gloom down upon you. A bit much, perhaps, but there are enough elements to allow for any number of other combinations. 	 	 	The pixie, wearing a tin can crown, watches from the middle of the grove, the sparkling villain approach. She sits down in gloom wondering if she belongs amongst the trees, for she has never seen such a beautiful shape. 	 	On-Yomi: ウツ   Kun-Yomi: うっ.する、 しげ.る、 ふさ.ぐ"
